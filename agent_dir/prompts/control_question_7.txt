The following python function:

```function```

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
```intention```

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
```library```

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
```error```

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

```belief_set_before```

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
```actionsQ7```

After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

```belief_set_after```


Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Given the long term goal description

```desire```

and the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

```belief_set```

propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function has to take as input 'belief_set' and must not modify it. The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

```library```

To include one of the library functions, you need to call them with 'belief_set' as argument. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value.

Do not modify the belief set in the function that you provide. The belief set is a copy of the original and is not updated when the agent executes the functions from the library.

When generating the short term goal description and the function, keep in mind that the function should not be of much higher complexity than the functions from the library: this is just a single step of an iterative process to populate the library. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
```memory```


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

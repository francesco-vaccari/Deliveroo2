Given the following goal description:
```desire```

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

```belief_set```


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

```belief_set_prior```


The function should work with both the current belief set and the previous belief set.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

The following function:

```function```

takes as input the current belief set, that is structured like the following example:

```belief_set```

The function should achieve the following short term goal description:
```intention```

However, when executed, the function gives the following runtime error:
```error```.


You have to modify and fix the function in order to achieve the short term goal description. The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

```library```

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Accessing directly the 'belief_set' is suggested. Assigning to local variables the value of 'belief_set' by accessing it with the approriate key will cause the local variables to not be updated as the assignment is only a copy and not a reference.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
```memory```


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

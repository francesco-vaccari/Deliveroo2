Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

```example_events```


The input event describes a change in the state of an object or entity in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of object. The function you will write will only be used to process events for the object '```object_type```'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The belief set is structured like this:

```belief_set```


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
```intention```

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

```belief_set_prior```


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

```actions```


The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

```belief_set_after```


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, you need to provide information that can be inferred from these elements. This information will be remembered by the agent and will be used to generate future goals and plans. If the agent has failed to achieve the goal, you should provide information about what went wrong in order to avoid the same mistake in the future. The most important thing is to learn what each action does, what could be its preconditions, and what could be its effects. Understanding how the actions change the state of the environment, reflected in the events received, is crucial.

Your response should also include the information currently stored in the agent's memory. You can correct or remove parts from the current memory if you think they are incorrect. This is the current memory:
```memory```




Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the textual information that you want to store in the agent's memory.

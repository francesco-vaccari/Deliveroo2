The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
```intention```

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

```belief_set_prior```


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

```actions```


The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

```belief_set_after```


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



Also, you need to write general information that you can infer from the given data about the effects of each action in the plan executed. The possible actions are: ```base_actons_list```. For each action write about the effect that you observed, integrating the information with what was learned in previous plan executions. The following is the information that the agent has learned so far:
```memory```



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.

Experiments:
    Single Agent:
        Learning:
            Configuration:
                - perception generation only on error
                - no desire triggering
                - no evaluation of triggered desires
            Limit:
                - agent delivers the parcel
                - 4 desires generated
            Types:
                (1) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 delivery cell                                                                             [1]
                (2) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 blocked delivery cell                                                                     [2]
                (3) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 free delivery cell and 1 blocked double points delivery cell                              [3]
                (4) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 blocked delivery cell and 1 blocked double points delivery cell                           [4]
        Continuous Learning:
            Configuration:
                - perception generation only on error
            Limit:
                - 4 desires generated
                - infinite desire triggers (both correct or incorrect, no further development is possibile)
                - energy runs out (immediate stop)
            Types:
                (1) 1 parcel spawn cell and 1 delivery cell                                                                             [5]
                (2) 1 parcel spawn cell and 1 delivery cell and 1 battery spawn cell                                                    [6]
                (3) 1 parcel spawn cell and 1 blocked delivery cell and 1 battery spawn cell (key not dropped in delivery cells)        [7]
        Dynamic environment:
            Configuration:
                - perception generation only on error
                - no desire triggering (automatically handled)
            Limit:
                - end of experiment after agent completes all steps
                - step is completed if agent reaches objective
                - if current step is completed, generation is interrupted until next step is activated
                - total limit of 12 desires for first 5 steps (otherwise experiment is stopped)
                - limit of 4 desires for last step
                - desire triggering is active only for last step in which the agent can execute desires implemented in previous steps
            Steps:
                1 - parcel spawn cell appears in (2,3) with 2 parcels with different score
                    ---> agent has to pick up parcels
                2 - delivery cell appears in (0,1)
                    ---> agent has to deliver parcels
                3 - battery spawn cell appears in (2,2) with 1 battery
                    ---> agent has to pick up battery
                4 - key appears in (1,0)
                    ---> agent has to pick up key
                5 - door appears in (3,2)
                    ---> agent has to leave key at door
                6 - delivery cell appears in (0,0) with doors in (0,1) and (1,0), parcel spawn cell appears in (2,3) with 2 parcels 
                    with different score, battery spawn cell appears in (3,2) with 1 battery, 1 key spawns in 2,2
                    ---> agent has to deliver the parcels, see if it uses old intentions, and see if it gets the battery
                
                Before each step the agent has to be moved to a valid position to not interefere with new elements
                Events regarding the agent have all fields (has_key and energy) from start of experiment
    
    Multiple Agents:
        Configuration:
            - perception generation only on error
            - no evaluation of triggered desires
        Types:
            (1) all objects but with 2 agents                                                                                           [10]
            (2) map is a line that forces agents to cooperate to deliver a parcel                                                       [11]

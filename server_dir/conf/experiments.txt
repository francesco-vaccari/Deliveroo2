Experiments:
    Single Agent:
        Learning:
            Configuration:
                - perception generation only on error
                - no desire triggering
                - no evaluation of triggered desires
            Limit:
                - agent delivers the parcel
                - 4 desires generated
            Types:
                (1) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 delivery cell                                                                             [1]
                (2) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 blocked delivery cell                                                                     [2]
                (3) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 free delivery cell and 1 blocked double points delivery cell                              [3]
                (4) 1 parcel to deliver and 1 blocked delivery cell and 1 blocked double points delivery cell                           [4]
        Continuous Learning:
            Configuration:
                - perception generation only on error
            Limit:
                - 4 desires generated
                - infinite desire triggers (both correct or incorrect, no further development is possibile)
            Types:
                (1) 1 parcel spawn cell and 1 delivery cell                                                                             [5]
                (2) 1 parcel spawn cell and 1 delivery cell and 1 battery spawn cell                                                    [6]
                (3) 1 parcel spawn cell and 1 blocked delivery cell and 1 battery spawn cell                                            [7]
        Dynamic environment:

    Multiple Agents:
        Configuration:
            - perception generation only on error
            - no evaluation of triggered desires
        Types:
            (1) all objects but with 2 agents                                                                                           [10]
            (2) map is a line that forces agents to cooperate to deliver a parcel                                                       [11]

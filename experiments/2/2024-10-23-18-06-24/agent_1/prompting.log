[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...



Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move the agent towards the parcel by one cell if the parcel is not in the same cell as the agent.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent's goal was to move towards the parcel by one cell. However, the agent moved from [1, 1] to [0, 1], while the parcel was at [0, 0]. Therefore, the agent did not move closer to the parcel. For improvement, the agent needs to analyze the coordinates of the parcel and itself, and plan a path that brings it closer to the parcel on each step. In this scenario, the agent should have moved to [1, 0] instead of [0, 1]."}

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move towards the parcel, pick it up, and then proceed towards the delivery cell to drop the parcel.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move towards the parcel, pick it up, and then proceed towards the delivery cell to drop the parcel.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The agent's function seems to be stuck in an infinite loop, particularly in the fourth loop where it is using function_4() as the action. To avoid such timeout errors, make sure to always have a termination condition that is guaranteed to be met within the time limit. In this case, the function should check if the agent's coordinates match those of the destination before repeating the action. If they do, the function should break the loop. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the parcel, pick it up, and then proceed towards the delivery cell to drop the parcel."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent's function seems to be stuck in an infinite loop, particularly in the fourth loop where it is using function_4() as the action. To avoid such timeout errors, make sure to always have a termination condition that is guaranteed to be met within the time limit. In this case, the function should check if the agent's coordinates match those of the destination before repeating the action. If they do, the function should break the loop. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the parcel, pick it up, and then proceed towards the delivery cell to drop the parcel.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    parcel_coordinates = belief_set['parcel'][1]['coordinates']
    agent_coordinates = belief_set['agent']['coordinates']
    delivery_coordinates = [i for i in belief_set['map']['grid'] if i['cell_type'] == 'delivery_cell'][0]['cell_coordinates']
    while agent_coordinates != parcel_coordinates:

            function_3()
        agent_coordinates = belief_set['agent']['coordinates']
    function_5()
    while agent_coordinates != delivery_coordinates:
        if agent_coordinates[0] < delivery_coordinates[0]:
            function_2()
        elif agent_coordinates[0] > delivery_coordinates[0]:
            function_1()
        elif agent_coordinates[1] < delivery_coordinates[1]:
            function_4()
        elif agent_coordinates[1] > delivery_coordinates[1]:
            function_3()
        agent_coordinates = belief_set['agent']['coordinates']
    function_6()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move the agent towards the parcel if it is not carrying any, pick it up, and then proceed towards the delivery cell to drop the parcel.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent towards the parcel if it is not carrying any, pick it up, and then proceed towards the delivery cell to drop the parcel.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_4 , Events received:

	- Action: action_4 , Events received:

	Summary of actions executed:
	- Action: action_5, Executed 1 times
	- Action: action_4, Executed 25 times


After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The agent was supposed to pick up a parcel and deliver it to a designated location. This error is likely due to an infinite loop in the agent's code. Since the agent's coordinates aren't updated in real-time within the while loop, the agent might get stuck in an infinite loop if the target isn't reached. To avoid this, ensure that the agent's current coordinates are updated within the loop after every move. In addition, add conditions to break the loop if the target is unreachable due to obstacles or if the agent isn't progressing as expected. Timeouts can also be handled by adding a maximum limit to the number of iterations or the execution time of the loop."}

- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_10()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the delivery cell and deliver all the parcels it is carrying. The function will navigate the agent through the map, avoiding non-walkable cells, to reach the delivery cell and then use the function to drop all the parcels.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to the delivery cell while avoiding non-walkable cells and deliver the parcel it is carrying.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

[CONTROL Q7]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    agent_coords = belief_set['agent']['coordinates']
    parcel_coords = belief_set['parcel'][1]['coordinates']
    delivery_coords = [x for x in belief_set['map']['grid'] if x['cell_type'] == 'delivery_cell'][0]['cell_coordinates']
    while agent_coords != parcel_coords:
        if agent_coords[0] < parcel_coords[0]:
            function_2()
        elif agent_coords[0] > parcel_coords[0]:
            function_1()
        elif agent_coords[1] < parcel_coords[1]:
            function_4()
        else:
            function_3()
    function_5()
    while agent_coords != delivery_coords:
        if agent_coords[0] < delivery_coords[0]:
            function_2()
        elif agent_coords[0] > delivery_coords[0]:
            function_1()
        elif agent_coords[1] < delivery_coords[1]:
            function_4()
        else:
            function_3()
    function_6()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to pick up the parcel, navigate to the delivery cell, and deliver the parcel by dropping it at the delivery cell.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_12()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to pick up the parcel, navigate to the delivery cell, and deliver the parcel by dropping it at the delivery cell.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.

Response: {"suggestions": "The agent was trying to pick up the parcel and deliver it to the delivery cell. The error occurred due to a timeout, which indicates an infinite loop of actions. One suggestion to avoid this in the future is to add a condition to break the loop after a certain number of iterations. Another suggestion is to update the agent's coordinates within the while loop since the current function seems to be relying on the agent's initial coordinates, which might have caused the agent to keep executing the same action indefinitely. Lastly, ensure that the environment allows an actual path for the agent to reach its target, as non-walkable cells may block the agent's path leading to an infinite loop of actions."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error was a timeout error, which indicates that there was an infinite loop in the function causing it to run for too long. This could be due to the fact that the agent is stuck in an infinite loop of performing the same action, which is increasing its second coordinate by 1, as there is no condition in the function to break this loop when it's not possible to reach the delivery cell by only increasing the second coordinate. To avoid such errors in future, the function should be written in a way that it includes conditions to handle all possible scenarios, including the edges of the map where the agent can't move further in a direction. Additionally, adding a condition to break the loop after a certain number of iterations could prevent the function from running indefinitely. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to deliver the parcel it was carrying to the delivery cell."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long-term goal is to successfully carry all available parcels to the designated delivery cell while avoiding non-walkable cells and collecting keys if necessary to open doors.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error was a timeout error, which indicates that there was an infinite loop in the function causing it to run for too long. This could be due to the fact that the agent is stuck in an infinite loop of performing the same action, which is increasing its second coordinate by 1, as there is no condition in the function to break this loop when it's not possible to reach the delivery cell by only increasing the second coordinate. To avoid such errors in future, the function should be written in a way that it includes conditions to handle all possible scenarios, including the edges of the map where the agent can't move further in a direction. Additionally, adding a condition to break the loop after a certain number of iterations could prevent the function from running indefinitely. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to deliver the parcel it was carrying to the delivery cell.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the delivery cell while carrying a parcel, taking into account the boundaries of the map to avoid infinite loops. The agent will try to increase its second coordinate (y-axis) as much as possible to reach the top part of the map, where the delivery cell is located. If it reaches the top boundary, it will try to move horizontally towards the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'.

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}

The function should achieve the following short term goal description:
The short term goal is for the agent to move one step closer to the delivery cell while avoiding non-walkable cells and picking up keys if necessary to open doors.

However, while testing the validity of the function the following error occured:
Error: Syntax error: closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '(' (<unknown>, line 13).


You have to modify and fix the function in order to achieve the short term goal description. The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move one step closer to the delivery cell while avoiding non-walkable cells and picking up keys if necessary to open doors.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent's goal was to move one step closer to the delivery cell, avoid non-walkable cells, and pick up keys if necessary. However, according to the belief set before and after the plan, the agent's coordinates did not change, indicating that the agent did not move. This might be due to the fact that the action_4 failed to move the agent or was an incorrect action. The plan generation should be improved by ensuring that the selected actions are valid and will lead to the desired change in the agent's position. Additionally, the agent should have a strategy to pick up keys when they are on its path."}

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move the agent towards the key, pick it up and then move towards the nearest door to unlock it.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved the short term goal. The agent has the key and has moved towards the door, but there is no event that indicates that the door has been unlocked. The plan generation can be improved by including an action to unlock the door after picking up the key. Also, it is crucial to ensure that the agent's actions result in corresponding changes in the environment, which can be verified through the events received after each action. In this case, an event indicating that a door's status has changed to unlocked would confirm that the agent has successfully unlocked the door."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to deliver the parcel it is currently carrying to the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    key_coords = belief_set['key'][1]['coordinates']
    agent_coords = belief_set['agent']['coordinates']
    while agent_coords != key_coords:
        if agent_coords[0] < key_coords[0]:
            function_2()
        elif agent_coords[0] > key_coords[0]:
            function_1()
        elif agent_coords[1] < key_coords[1]:
            function_4()
        else:
            function_3()
    function_5()
    door_coords = belief_set['door'][1]['coordinates']
    while agent_coords != door_coords:
        if agent_coords[0] < door_coords[0]:
            function_2()
        elif agent_coords[0] > door_coords[0]:
            function_1()
        elif agent_coords[1] < door_coords[1]:
            function_4()
        else:
            function_3()
    function_6()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the key, pick it up, and then move towards the door to unlock it.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_17()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to deliver the parcel it is currently carrying to the delivery cell.
- function_18()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the key, pick it up, and then move towards the door to unlock it.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 20}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "To avoid a timeout error such as this one, checks should be included in the loop that allow the agent to break from the loop if it has been running for an excessively long time. This will prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop. In this specific case, the error likely occurred because the agent was trying to move to a non-walkable cell or a cell outside of the grid, which is not possible. To avoid this, the agent's actions should be validated against the map's grid before execution. A check should be included to ensure the agent does not attempt to move to a non-walkable cell or outside the grid. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the key, pick it up, and then move towards the door to unlock it."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to collect all available keys in the environment, unlock all doors and deliver all parcels to the designated delivery cell, while maximizing its score.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 20}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_17()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to deliver the parcel it is currently carrying to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
To avoid a timeout error such as this one, checks should be included in the loop that allow the agent to break from the loop if it has been running for an excessively long time. This will prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop. In this specific case, the error likely occurred because the agent was trying to move to a non-walkable cell or a cell outside of the grid, which is not possible. To avoid this, the agent's actions should be validated against the map's grid before execution. A check should be included to ensure the agent does not attempt to move to a non-walkable cell or outside the grid. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the key, pick it up, and then move towards the door to unlock it.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to have the agent move towards the delivery cell, and upon reaching the cell, it should deliver the parcel if it is carrying any.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 20}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 20}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'carried_by_id': 1}}
- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 20}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}
- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 20}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 20}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent didn't achieve the goal because it didn't carry any parcel to the delivery cell. The agent needs to first pick up a parcel from the parcels_spawn cell before moving to the delivery cell. This can be achieved by generating a plan that first directs the agent to the parcels_spawn cell, then directs it to the delivery cell.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to collect all available keys in the environment, unlock all doors and deliver all parcels to the designated delivery cell, while maximizing its score.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move to the parcels_spawn cell, pick up a parcel, and then move to the delivery cell to deliver the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 20}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent failed to achieve the short term goal of picking up a parcel from the parcels_spawn cell and delivering it to the delivery cell. The actions performed indicate that the agent moved to the parcels_spawn cell (coordinates [0, 0]) but there was no event indicating that the agent picked up a parcel. The agent then moved back to the delivery cell without carrying a parcel. The agent also released the key at the delivery cell but this action is unnecessary for the goal. To improve the plan generation, the agent should include an action to pick up a parcel when it reaches the parcels_spawn cell. The agent should also keep the key as it might be needed later."}

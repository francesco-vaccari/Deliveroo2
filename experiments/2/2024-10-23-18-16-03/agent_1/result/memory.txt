- The agent did not manage to achieve the short term goal. While the agent was able to move to the key and pick it up, it did not move towards the nearest door to open it. The agent should have executed an action that would move it from its current position [1, 1] to the position of the nearest door either at [1, 2] or [0, 2]. Consider improving the plan generation by ensuring that the agent performs actions not only to pick up keys, but also to move towards doors and open them when a key is in possession.

- The error that occurred was a timeout error, indicating that the function likely entered an infinite loop. This could be because the while loop in the function does not have a proper terminating condition. The agent is trying to reach the parcel's coordinates but there's no code to update the agent's coordinates within the while loop, so the loop never ends. It is crucial to ensure that the agent's coordinates are updated in the belief set every time a move action is executed. This can be done by implementing a function to handle the agent's movement, which would update the agent's coordinates in the belief set after every move. Another suggestion is to add a maximum limit to the number of iterations in the while loop to avoid infinite loops. Furthermore, the algorithm used here does not consider the map layout which can lead to the agent trying to move into non-walkable cells. The agent should consider the map layout and avoid non-walkable cells. A path finding algorithm like A* could be used to find the shortest path to the parcel avoiding non-walkable cells. Finally, the agent's short term goal was to move towards and pick up a parcel in its vicinity.
- The agent's short term goal was to move towards and pick up the nearest parcel, while avoiding non-walkable cells. From the given action and the events received, it can be seen that the agent picked up the parcel but did not move from its initial coordinates. To improve the plan generation, it is suggested to incorporate the action of moving towards the nearest parcel in the plan. This can be done by calculating the shortest path to the nearest parcel that avoids non-walkable cells, and then generating actions to follow this path before picking up the parcel.

- The agent has not achieved the short term goal. The short term goal was to move towards the delivery cell while carrying parcels and to drop them there. However, the agent is still carrying the parcel and has not reached the delivery cell. The agent is currently at coordinates [1, 0], and the delivery cell is at coordinates [1, 3]. The plan needs to include actions that move the agent to the delivery cell. Additionally, once the agent is at the delivery cell, the plan should include an action to drop the parcel.
- 
- The agent has not yet reached the delivery cell while carrying the parcel, which was the stated goal. The agent is currently at coordinates [1, 1] with the parcel, and the delivery cell is at coordinates [1, 3]. The agent needs to continue moving towards the delivery cell. Future plans should include the necessary actions to reach the delivery cell.

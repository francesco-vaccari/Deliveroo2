- The function seems to have run into a timeout error, which indicates that the function was taking too long to complete. This is usually due to an infinite loop in the code that doesn't meet a stop condition. In this case, the loop in the function continues until the agent's coordinates match the key's coordinates. However, the function may not be updating the agent's coordinates correctly or the key's coordinates cannot be reached by the agent, causing the loop to continue indefinitely. To avoid this, make sure that the movement functions (function_1, function_2, function_3, function_4) are correctly updating the agent's coordinates in the belief set. Also, the function should include a condition to break the loop if the key's coordinates are unreachable. Furthermore, consider adding a maximum number of iterations for the loop as a fail-safe to avoid infinite loops. To recap, the short-term goal was to move the agent to the cell that contains the key and pick up the key.
- The agent has not achieved the short term goal. The goal was for the agent to pick up the key, navigate to the door and unlock it. The agent did successfully pick up the key and move towards the door, but it did not complete the final step of unlocking the door. In the future, plan should include an action for the agent to interact with the door and unlock it once it has reached the door's coordinates. Also, ensure that the agent has the necessary key to unlock the door before it attempts to do so.
- The error that occurred was due to a timeout, which typically indicates an infinite loop or a very long sequence of actions in the function. In this case, the agent continuously performs the action_4, which increases its second coordinate by 1. However, the agent's second coordinate is already at the maximum value, hence the action_4 does not change the agent's coordinates. To avoid such errors in the future, it is recommended to always include boundary checks in the functions. For instance, before calling action_4, check if the agent's second coordinate is less than the height of the grid. This will prevent the agent from trying to move outside the grid, which in turn will prevent infinite loops. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to deliver the parcel it is currently carrying to the delivery cell.

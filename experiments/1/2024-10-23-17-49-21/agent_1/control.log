2024-10-23 17:50:13,789 - INFO - [LOOP] Obtained memory update: The agent's goal was to navigate towards the closest parcel and pick it up. The agent successfully navigated to the cell containing the parcel, but it did not pick up the parcel, as evidenced by the 'parcels_carried_ids' field in the final belief set still being empty. The plan generation process needs to be improved by ensuring that an action to pick up the parcel is added to the plan after the agent has navigated to the parcel's location. This could be achieved by checking the 'parcels_carried_ids' field of the agent in the belief set, and if it is empty, adding a 'pick up parcel' action to the plan.

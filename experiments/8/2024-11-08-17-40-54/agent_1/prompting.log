Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"function": "def update_belief_set(event, belief_set):\n    if 'map' not in belief_set:\n        belief_set['map'] = {}\n    if event['event_type'] == 'object added' or event['event_type'] == 'object changed':\n        belief_set['map'] = event['object']\n    elif event['event_type'] == 'object removed':\n        belief_set['map'] = {}\n    return belief_set"}

Provide a long term goal description in natural language:
- do not reference specific instances of the belief set
- keep it general, abstract and high level

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should strive to collect as many parcels as possible from the parcels spawn point and deliver them to their respective destinations while maintaining a high energy level.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


This is the belief set of the agent after having executed the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent should strive to collect as many parcels as possible from the parcels spawn point and deliver them to their respective destinations while maintaining a high energy level.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal should be to move to a neighboring cell, while conserving energy, to explore the map and discover new cells and their types. If a parcel is present in the new cell, the agent should pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 93}}
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_5 , Events received:

The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 93}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 93}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 92}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 92}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    agent = belief_set['agent']
    map_grid = belief_set['map']['grid']
    delivery_cell = next((cell for cell in map_grid if cell['cell_type'] == 'delivery_cell'), None)
    if not delivery_cell:
        return
    delivery_coordinates = delivery_cell['cell_coordinates']
    while agent['coordinates'] != delivery_coordinates and agent['energy'] > 10:
        if agent['coordinates'][0] > delivery_coordinates[0]:
            function_1()
        elif agent['coordinates'][0] < delivery_coordinates[0]:
            function_2()
        elif agent['coordinates'][1] > delivery_coordinates[1]:
            function_3()
        elif agent['coordinates'][1] < delivery_coordinates[1]:
            function_4()
    if agent['coordinates'] == delivery_coordinates and agent['parcels_carried_ids']:
        function_6()


was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move the agent towards a delivery cell while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_10()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent towards a delivery cell while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 92}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error indicates that the agent's function timed out after 15 seconds. This suggests that the agent entered an infinite loop due to the agent not reaching the delivery cell. To avoid this, consider adding a maximum number of actions the agent can perform before stopping. Additionally, verify that the conditions for the agent to move towards the delivery cell are correct and that there is a valid path to the delivery cell. There could be obstacles or non-walkable cells preventing the agent from reaching the delivery cell. Lastly, remember to update the agent's belief set after each action to reflect the new environment state. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards a delivery cell while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score."}

[CONTROL Q2MEM]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to explore the entire map to discover all cells and their types while conserving its energy and maintaining a high score by delivering parcels when possible.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error indicates that the agent's function timed out after 15 seconds. This suggests that the agent entered an infinite loop due to the agent not reaching the delivery cell. To avoid this, consider adding a maximum number of actions the agent can perform before stopping. Additionally, verify that the conditions for the agent to move towards the delivery cell are correct and that there is a valid path to the delivery cell. There could be obstacles or non-walkable cells preventing the agent from reaching the delivery cell. Lastly, remember to update the agent's belief set after each action to reflect the new environment state.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 89}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 87}}
- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 86}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 86}, 'parcels': {}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


This is the belief set of the agent after having executed the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 86}, 'parcels': {}}

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent should aim to explore the entire map to discover all cells and their types while conserving its energy and maintaining a high score by delivering parcels when possible.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 86}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'battery', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'battery'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 86}, 'parcels': {}}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'battery' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'battery'.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move the agent towards the nearest battery, if it is reachable and then pick it up to increase the agent's energy level.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 86}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {1: [2, 2]}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {1: [2, 2]}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The Agent hasn't achieved the short term goal. The goal was to move towards the nearest battery and pick it up. However, the agent only moved from coordinates [0, 2] to [1, 2], and it didn't reach the battery at [2, 2]. Also, the energy level of the agent decreased from 86 to 85, showing that the battery was not picked up. To improve plan generation, ensure the plan includes actions that move the agent to the battery's coordinates. Also, the plan should include an action to pick up the battery after reaching it."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to find and collect batteries to maintain a high energy level, while navigating through the walkable cells and avoiding any obstacles or hazards in the environment.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {1: [2, 2]}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...



Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short-term goal is to navigate towards the location of the batteries on the map, and collect them to maintain a high energy level.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {1: [2, 2]}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_2 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 84}}
	- Action: action_2 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 83}}

	Summary of actions executed:
	- Action: action_2, Executed 27 times


After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 83}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {1: [2, 2]}}


Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error occurred due to an infinite loop of actions, which caused the function to timeout. The agent was trying to achieve the short-term goal of navigating towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them. To avoid such errors, ensure to implement boundary checks and conditions to break the loop when the agent reaches the target or when there is no viable path, as in this case, where the agent kept trying to increase its first coordinate even after reaching the map's limit. Additionally, a safety counter could be used to limit the number of iterations and prevent infinite loops."}

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 83}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {1: [2, 2]}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 82}}
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 100}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'battery', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2]}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 100}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to find and collect batteries to maintain a high energy level, while navigating through the walkable cells and avoiding any obstacles or hazards in the environment.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 86}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {1: [2, 2]}}


This is the belief set of the agent after having executed the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 100}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}}

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'key'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 100}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'key' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'key'.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error is due to a timeout, which indicates that the agent is stuck in an infinite loop. This is likely because the agent's position in the belief set is not being updated after each action, causing the while loop to run indefinitely. To prevent this, ensure the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action. Additionally, the function should include a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops."}

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to collect keys scattered across the map, keeping its energy level optimal, to unlock special bonuses or areas that enhance its performance and score.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error is due to a timeout, which indicates that the agent is stuck in an infinite loop. This is likely because the agent's position in the belief set is not being updated after each action, causing the while loop to run indefinitely. To prevent this, ensure the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action. Additionally, the function should include a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 96}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 57, 'energy': 95}}
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 94}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

The agent should aim to collect keys scattered across the map, keeping its energy level optimal, to unlock special bonuses or areas that enhance its performance and score.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'door', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'door'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'door' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'door'.

Provide a long term goal description in natural language:
- do not reference specific instances of the belief set
- keep it general, abstract and high level
- keep it brief (1-2 sentences)

The long term goal you have to provide should be different from the ones already implemented. These are the descriptions of the already implemented long term goals:
- The agent should strive to collect as many parcels as possible from the parcels spawn point and deliver them to their respective destinations while maintaining a high energy level.
- The agent should aim to collect keys scattered across the map, keeping its energy level optimal, to unlock special bonuses or areas that enhance its performance and score.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan was empty: no actions executed and no events received.

After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error message indicates that the function timed out, which means it did not complete within the allocated time. This is typically caused by an infinite loop in the code where the termination condition is never met. To avoid such issues in the future, ensure that all loops have a valid termination condition that is guaranteed to be met. Also, consider adding a maximum iteration limit to the loops as a failsafe. In addition, when writing similar functions, always consider the worst-case scenario and aim to optimize the function to handle large inputs efficiently. In this case, the agent's short-term goal was to move towards the unexplored part of the map, by choosing the next walkable cell, while ensuring it has enough energy to perform the movement.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to the next unexplored cell in the map. If the agent's energy level is below a threshold, the agent should move towards the nearest battery to recharge.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 93}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'carried_by_id': 1}}
- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 92}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 92}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent's short term goal was to move to the next unexplored cell in the map and move towards the nearest battery to recharge if the energy level is below a threshold. However, there is no information about the exploration status of the cells in the map, and there are no batteries present in the map for the agent to recharge. The plan generation needs to be improved by including actions that help in identifying unexplored cells and actions that lead the agent to batteries when the energy level is below a certain threshold."}

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error message indicates a timeout error, suggesting that the function likely entered an infinite loop. This could be due to the function continuously checking for conditions that do not change, leading to an endless cycle of checks without any actions being executed. To avoid this in the future, make sure that the conditions checked in the function will eventually change due to the actions executed by the agent, allowing the function to exit. Additionally, consider implementing safeguards to break the loop if it exceeds a certain number of iterations. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move to an adjacent cell, if it's walkable and the agent's energy is above 50. If the agent's energy dropped below this threshold, the agent would stop moving to conserve energy."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of batteries on the map and collect them, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
To avoid this error, ensure that the function doesn't fall into an infinite loop of actions. In this case, the agent is continuously executing function_4 even when the agent reaches the edge of the map. The function needs to take into account the map boundaries and stop or change direction when it reaches the edge. You may consider adding a check to the while loop that accounts for the agent's position and stops execution when it reaches the edge of the map. The short term goal was to explore the map in the positive direction of the second coordinate while maintaining a high energy level. If the energy level drops below 30, the agent will use function_14 to navigate towards the battery to recharge.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to explore the map in the positive direction of the second coordinate until it reaches the edge of the map or its energy level drops below 30. Upon reaching the boundary or energy dropping below 30, the agent will navigate towards the nearest battery to recharge.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 90}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

The plan was empty: no actions executed and no events received.


The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 90}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move one cell to the right, if it's a walkable cell and if the agent's energy level is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 90}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 90}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved the short term goal of moving one cell to the right in the map. From the given belief set, it is clear that the agent's position has not changed after the execution of the plan. This can be due to the failure of the action performed. For improving the plan generation, it is suggested to include more robust error handling and contingency plans for when actions fail. Also, the plan generation algorithm should check if the preconditions for an action are met before including it in the plan. In this case, before planning to move to a cell, the algorithm should check if the cell is walkable and if the agent has enough energy to perform the move."}

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to explore the entire map, identifying all walkable cells, while maintaining a high level of energy and collecting any objects of interest it encounters along the way.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 89}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.
- function_24()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move one cell down on the map if it is a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above 50, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move one cell in each direction (up, down, left, right) if it is a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above 50, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy. If there is an object in the same cell as the agent, it will pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 89}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 88}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}
- Action: action_2 , Events received:

	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}
- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent was supposed to move one cell in each direction (up, down, left, right) but it did not, as it only moved up and down (from [1, 3] to [0, 3] and back). The agent could improve its plan by ensuring that it covers all directions. Additionally, the agent was also supposed to pick up any object in the cell it was in, but it already had the object (key with id: 1) at the start and did not encounter any new objects. For future plans, the agent could also be more aware of its environment and check for nearby objects before planning to pick up any objects."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to explore the entire map, identifying all walkable cells, while maintaining a high level of energy and collecting any objects of interest it encounters along the way.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the location of the key on the map and collect it, taking into account the boundary checks and avoiding infinite loops. It ensures the agent's position in the belief set is updated after each action and includes a condition to break the loop if the key's position is unreachable or if the agent's energy is insufficient.
- function_24()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move one cell down on the map if it is a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above 50, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan was empty: no actions executed and no events received.

After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 57, 'energy': 85}, 'parcels': {}, 'batteries': {}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 2]}}}


Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error that occurred was a timeout error, indicating that the function did not complete within the set time limit. This is usually caused by an infinite loop in the function. To avoid this error in the future, consider the following suggestions: 1. Avoid infinite loops: Ensure that the conditions set for the loop will eventually be met. This can be done through rigorous testing and validation. 2. Implement a fail-safe: Include a mechanism to break the loop after a certain number of iterations to prevent the loop from running indefinitely. 3. Optimize the function: If the function is complex and takes a long time to execute, consider optimizing it to reduce execution time. This may involve reducing the complexity of calculations or using more efficient data structures. 4. Check edge cases: Ensure that the function can handle edge cases correctly. In this specific function, for example, consider what happens when the agent is at the edge of the map and cannot move in one or more directions. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move left, down, right and up successively, provided each direction is a walkable cell and the agent's energy is sufficient. This allows the agent to explore the map while conserving energy."}

Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}

Example 2:
{'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}

Example 3:
{'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'key'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'key' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'key'.

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should strive to collect as many parcels as possible from the parcels spawn point and deliver them to their respective destinations while maintaining a high energy level.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_24()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move one cell down on the map if it is a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above 50, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest key, if it doesn't already have one, and pick it up. If the agent already has a key, it should move towards the nearest door and unlock it.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 96}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent's short-term goal is to pick up a key if it doesn't have one or move towards the door and unlock it if it does have a key. In this case, the agent doesn't have a key yet, so it should have moved towards the nearest key and picked it up. However, according to the actions performed and the events received, the agent only moved towards the key's coordinates but didn't pick it up. This suggests that the plan generation should be improved by adding an action for the agent to pick up the key when it reaches the key's location."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_24()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move one cell down on the map if it is a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above 50, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the key, if it is in a nearby cell, and pick it up. If the agent's energy drops below a certain threshold, it should move towards the nearest battery and pick it up to replenish its energy.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0, 'energy': 95}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest door if the agent has a key, and unlock it. If the agent's energy drops below a certain threshold, it should move towards the nearest battery and pick it up to replenish its energy.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

The plan was empty: no actions executed and no events received.


The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0, 'energy': 94}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent did not perform any actions in its plan, therefore it did not move towards the nearest door nor did it attempt to unlock it. Likewise, it did not move towards a battery or pick it up. To improve plan generation, the agent should first check if it has a key, which it does in this case. Then, it should calculate the shortest path to the nearest door and generate a sequence of movements to reach the door. Once it reaches the door, it should perform the unlock action. The agent should also monitor its energy levels during plan execution. If its energy drops below the threshold, it should calculate the shortest path to the nearest battery, interrupt its current plan, and generate a new plan to pick up the battery before resuming its previous plan."}

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest door that has not been unlocked, if the agent has a key. If the agent's energy drops below a certain threshold, it should move towards the nearest battery and pick it up to replenish its energy levels.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0, 'energy': 93}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0, 'energy': 92}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has moved, but it hasn't reached a door or unlocked it, even though it has a key. It also didn't move towards a battery, although its energy level is above the threshold. The agent needs to improve its move planning to target the nearest door for unlocking. It could use a path-finding algorithm to do this. The energy management of the agent could also be improved, for instance by defining a strategy for when to recharge based on the distance to the nearest battery and the energy cost associated with the planned path."}

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal of the agent is to move towards the delivery cell while carrying parcels, and if the agent is at the delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. The agent should also manage its energy reserves wisely to be able to continue its tasks.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [3, 4], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0, 'energy': 92}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'batteries': {2: [3, 2]}, 'keys': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 1]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 0]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 15, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 42, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved the short term goal as it did not drop the parcels at the delivery cell to increase the score. The agent only moved towards the delivery cell but the parcels are still being carried by the agent. To improve plan generation, the agent should have included an action to drop the parcels when it reaches the delivery cell. The agent also needs to ensure it has enough energy to perform this action, so energy management should also be considered during plan generation."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The agent should move to the parcel spawn point and collect all the parcels.
- function_9()	Description: The short-term goal is to move the agent one cell to the left on the map, if it's a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above a certain threshold, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards a delivery cell if there is one in its vicinity while conserving energy. If the agent is carrying parcels and is in a delivery cell, it should drop the parcels to increase the score. This function will limit the agent's actions to a maximum number to prevent infinite loops.
- function_24()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move one cell down on the map if it is a walkable cell and the agent's energy is above 50, to continue exploring the map and conserving energy.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal of the agent is to deliver the parcels it is currently carrying to the delivery cell, and then move towards the batteries spawn point to recharge its energy if the energy level is below 50.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent failed to achieve the short term goal. The agent did not collect any parcels as it was supposed to according to the goal. This could be due to the fact that the agent did not have a plan to collect the parcels. In the future, the plan should include actions to move towards the parcels spawn cell and collect the parcels. Also, the agent did not deliver any parcels as there were no parcels in its possession. Therefore, the agent should first collect the parcels before moving towards the delivery cell. Finally, the agent's energy dropped below 50, which also contradicts the goal. The agent should include in its plan actions to recharge the energy if it is about to fall below 50. It could do this by moving towards the batteries spawn cell and collecting a battery."}

2024-11-08 17:52:11,763 - INFO - [LOOP] Obtained memory update: The agent has not achieved the short term goal. The agent has successfully delivered the parcels as indicated by the events received and the change in the agent's score. However, the agent has not moved towards the batteries spawn point to recharge its energy as the energy level is below 50. To improve plan generation, the agent should take into account its current energy level. If the energy level is below 50 after delivering the parcels, the agent should plan to move towards the batteries spawn point.

2024-11-08 17:52:27,867 - INFO - [LOOP] Obtained memory update: The agent failed to achieve the short term goal. The agent did not collect any parcels as it was supposed to according to the goal. This could be due to the fact that the agent did not have a plan to collect the parcels. In the future, the plan should include actions to move towards the parcels spawn cell and collect the parcels. Also, the agent did not deliver any parcels as there were no parcels in its possession. Therefore, the agent should first collect the parcels before moving towards the delivery cell. Finally, the agent's energy dropped below 50, which also contradicts the goal. The agent should include in its plan actions to recharge the energy if it is about to fall below 50. It could do this by moving towards the batteries spawn cell and collecting a battery.

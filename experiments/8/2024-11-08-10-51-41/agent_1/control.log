2024-11-08 10:54:33,171 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error that occurred was a timeout error, often indicating an infinite loop or a computation that takes too long to complete. Given the nature of the function, it's likely that the issue lies in the loop where the function tries to find a walkable cell closer to the delivery cell. If the agent is stuck in a position where there is no walkable cell in the direction of the delivery cell, the loop can become infinite. To avoid this, you could add a condition to break the loop if no such walkable cell is found after checking all directions. Also, it's better to sort the delivery_cells based on the distance from the agent, so the agent will first try to move towards the nearest delivery cell. Lastly, consider adding a maximum number of iterations for the loop to prevent potential infinite loops. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move one step closer to the nearest delivery cell, if such a cell is walkable and the agent has enough energy to make the move.

The agent picked up the key in its location, but it did not move towards the parcel or the battery. The agent needs to consider the energy level and the distances to the parcel and battery when planning actions.

Secondly, to prevent timeout errors due to infinite loops, you should ensure that the function can handle cases where it cannot reach its intended destination due to obstacles. This could be done by incorporating a limit on the number of moves the agent can make, or by adding a condition to break the loop if the agent's position does not change after a move. Additionally, you could also implement a pathfinding algorithm like A* to compute the shortest path to the destination.

2024-11-08 11:02:22,001 - INFO - [LOOP] Obtained memory update: The agent is not in the state where it has achieved its short term goal. The goal was to move the agent towards the delivery cell and if it's already there, drop all the parcels it's carrying. However, from the events and the final belief state, it can be seen that even though the agent has moved to the delivery cell, it still hasn't dropped the parcels it's carrying. The agent should have executed an action to drop the parcels at the delivery cell. To improve plan generation, the agent should include actions that not only move it to the desired location but also perform any necessary actions at that location, such as dropping off parcels at the delivery cell. Moreover, the agent should consider its energy levels in the plan generation process to ensure it can execute the full plan.

- 
- The agent has not achieved the short term goal of delivering the parcels to a specified location. The agent moved to the parcels spawn location, picked up the parcels, but then moved back to its original location and dropped the parcels there. The agent should have moved to the specified delivery location before dropping the parcels. The plan should be adjusted to include a step where the agent checks the delivery location before dropping the parcels. Also, the agent might need to have knowledge about the delivery location in its belief set.
- 
- The agent has managed to pick up the parcels but it has not yet delivered them to the delivery point. The agent should continue the plan by moving towards the delivery point and executing the action to drop the parcels. To improve plan generation, ensure that the plan includes all necessary steps to fully achieve the goal, in this case, include steps for moving to the delivery point and dropping off the parcels.
- 
- The agent is trying to move towards the parcel spawn location while maintaining its energy level. However, from the given belief set, it is apparent that the agent only moved to the [1,0] position starting from the [0,0] position. The parcel spawn location is at [2,3], so the agent has not reached its goal. The agent also has not maintained its energy level as it decreased from 87 to 86. To improve plan generation, the agent should consider actions that move it closer to the parcel spawn location more efficiently. Additionally, the plan should include steps to preserve or replenish the agent's energy, such as taking shorter routes or resting if an energy resource is available in the environment.
- 
- The agent's short term goal was to move to the delivery cell while preserving energy. The agent did preserve energy but it moved to a walkable cell instead of the delivery cell. The plan needs to be improved to make sure that the agent is directed towards the delivery cell. This can be done by improving the navigation algorithm to correctly identify and move the agent towards the cell of type 'delivery_cell' in the map grid.
- 
- 
- The error that occurred was a timeout error, often indicating an infinite loop or a computation that takes too long to complete. Given the nature of the function, it's likely that the issue lies in the loop where the function tries to find a walkable cell closer to the delivery cell. If the agent is stuck in a position where there is no walkable cell in the direction of the delivery cell, the loop can become infinite. To avoid this, you could add a condition to break the loop if no such walkable cell is found after checking all directions. Also, it's better to sort the delivery_cells based on the distance from the agent, so the agent will first try to move towards the nearest delivery cell. Lastly, consider adding a maximum number of iterations for the loop to prevent potential infinite loops. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move one step closer to the nearest delivery cell, if such a cell is walkable and the agent has enough energy to make the move.

- 
- The agent has not reached the battery spawn location yet. The agent is currently at [1, 2], while the battery spawn location is at [2, 2]. The plan should include more move actions to get the agent to the correct location. The agent also needs to ensure that it has enough energy to reach the destination.
- 
- 
- The agent didn't achieve the goal of moving towards the nearest key, picking it up if it's in the same cell, and if the agent already has a key, to keep it. The agent's position moved closer to the key, however, it did not make it to the cell with the key. The agent should plan its movements such that it ends up in the same cell as the key. Then, it should execute an action to pick up the key.
- 
- The agent is trying to achieve the goal of moving towards the nearest key while maintaining its energy. However, the agent has not achieved its goal as it has not reached the key yet. To improve the plan generation, the agent should consider the shortest path to the key. In this case, the agent should have moved towards [1, 0] where the key is located. The agent does have enough energy to reach the key, so energy conservation isn't an issue here.
- 
- 
- The agent has not reached the door which is at coordinates [3, 2] as it is at coordinates [2, 2]. The agent also has not attempted to unlock the door. These are the two conditions necessary for the short term goal. One suggestion for improving plan generation is to ensure that the agent moves to the correct coordinates of the door and attempts to unlock it if it has a key. The plan should also consider the agent's energy levels to ensure it can reach the door and perform the unlock action.
- 
- The agent did not attempt to open the door after it moved to its coordinates. This could be because the agent's plan did not include the action to attempt to open the door. In order to improve the plan generation, the agent should include the action to attempt to open the door when it is at the same coordinates as the door and it has a key.
- 
- The agent did not achieve its short term goal because it did not perform any actions as the plan was empty. The agent should have moved towards the nearest door since it has a key and enough energy. It seems like the planning phase did not generate a valid plan for the agent. Possible improvements could be: Ensure that the planning algorithm correctly identifies when the agent has a key and enough energy, and that it can calculate the shortest path to the nearest door. If there are multiple doors, the plan should prioritize the nearest one.
- 
- The agent is still at the same coordinates as it started, and it has not picked up any parcels or keys, nor has it moved towards a battery cell. This suggests that the plan execution did not start or there was a failure in the first action, as there is only one action listed and no events were received. To improve plan generation, ensure that the first action in the plan is feasible given the initial state of the environment and the agent's capabilities. For example, if the first action requires the agent to move to a cell, check that the cell is walkable and within the agent's reach. Additionally, it may be beneficial to include error handling in the plan generation to accommodate for potential action failures.
- 
- The agent has not achieved its short term goal. The agent was supposed to pick up the parcel from the nearest location while preserving energy. However, the agent moved only one cell and is still not at the location of the parcel. To improve the plan generation, the agent should calculate the shortest distance to the parcel, and plan its path considering its current energy level. If the energy is not sufficient, the agent should include picking up a battery in its plan.
- 
- The agent did not achieve the short term goal of moving towards the nearest parcel and picking it up. The agent moved towards the coordinates [2,2] where a key is located, not a parcel. The agent should improve its plan generation by correctly identifying the coordinates of the nearest parcel and plan its movements towards that parcel. It also needs to include an action to pick up the parcel once it reaches the same cell as the parcel.
- 
- The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest parcel or key to pick it up, but also to preserve energy by moving towards the nearest battery if energy is low. The agent picked up the key in its location, but it did not move towards the parcel or the battery. The agent needs to consider the energy level and the distances to the parcel and battery when planning actions. If the energy is low and the battery is closer, the agent should move towards the battery first. If the parcel is closer or the energy is sufficient, the agent should move towards the parcel. The strategy for generating a plan should take these factors into account.
- 
- The agent has not achieved the short term goal as it has not picked up any parcels nor delivered them to a delivery cell. To improve plan generation, the agent should include actions to pick up the parcels located at coordinates [2, 3]. Then, the agent should move to the delivery cell located at coordinates [0, 0] to drop off the parcels. The agent should also make sure to plan its actions to conserve energy, as executing actions reduces the agent's energy level.
- 
- To prevent this error in the future, firstly, you should check if the coordinates of the agent, parcels, and delivery cell are within the map grid to avoid IndexErrors. Secondly, to prevent timeout errors due to infinite loops, you should ensure that the function can handle cases where it cannot reach its intended destination due to obstacles. This could be done by incorporating a limit on the number of moves the agent can make, or by adding a condition to break the loop if the agent's position does not change after a move. Additionally, you could also implement a pathfinding algorithm like A* to compute the shortest path to the destination. Finally, consider performing checks to ensure that the agent has enough energy to reach its destination and return for charging if needed. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up and then head to the nearest delivery cell to drop it off, while ensuring the agent has enough energy.
- 
- The agent has not achieved the short term goal. The agent's goal was to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up while preserving energy. However, from the performed action and events received, it's clear that the agent only moved towards the parcel but didn't pick it up. To improve the plan generation, the agent should include an action to pick up the parcel after reaching the same cell as the parcel. Moreover, the agent needs to ensure that the parcel is not being carried by another agent before attempting to pick it up.
- 
- The agent did not achieve its short term goal. The plan was to move the agent towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, then move towards the nearest delivery cell to drop the parcel, and recharge at a battery cell if energy is low. The agent did pick up the parcels which is a step towards the goal. However, the agent did not move towards the delivery cell to drop the parcels nor did it move towards the battery cell to recharge its energy. The agent stayed at the same coordinates [2, 3] throughout the plan execution. To improve plan generation, the agent needs to include actions that moves it towards the delivery cell after picking up the parcels. Also, the plan should include steps to check the agent's energy levels and move towards the nearest battery cell to recharge if energy is low.
- 
- The agent has moved closer to the delivery cell, but it isn't there yet, so the short term goal wasn't achieved. Also, the agent hasn't recharged its energy level. To improve plan generation, the agent should consider its energy level and the location of the nearest battery. If the energy level is below the threshold, it should prioritize moving towards and using the battery. Once the energy level is sufficient, it should then move towards the nearest delivery cell. In this case, since the energy level was above the threshold, the agent was correct to move towards the delivery cell. However, the plan should have included more actions to ensure the agent actually reaches the delivery cell. The agent should generate a plan that ensures it reaches the delivery cell within its current energy level.
- 
- The agent is not in the state where it has achieved its short term goal. The goal was to move the agent towards the delivery cell and if it's already there, drop all the parcels it's carrying. However, from the events and the final belief state, it can be seen that even though the agent has moved to the delivery cell, it still hasn't dropped the parcels it's carrying. The agent should have executed an action to drop the parcels at the delivery cell. To improve plan generation, the agent should include actions that not only move it to the desired location but also perform any necessary actions at that location, such as dropping off parcels at the delivery cell. Moreover, the agent should consider its energy levels in the plan generation process to ensure it can execute the full plan.

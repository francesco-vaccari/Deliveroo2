2024-11-07 18:41:38,891 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error received was a timeout error indicating that the function did not complete execution within the set time limit. This suggests that the function might have entered into an infinite loop. In the given function, there are two while loops where the agent's coordinates are compared with the coordinates of the nearest_parcel and delivery_cell respectively. If the agent is unable to reach these coordinates, for example due to a wall or obstacle, the loops would run indefinitely, leading to a timeout error. Hence, the function should be updated to handle such scenarios. A possibility is to include pathfinding algorithms that can navigate around obstacles. Another suggestion is to include a maximum limit to the number of actions that can be performed within a single execution of the function. This can help in avoiding infinite loops and ensure that the function completes within the set time limit. Additionally, perform checks to ensure that the target locations (parcel and delivery cell) are accessible from the agent's current location before entering the while loop. To recap, the agent's short term goal was to navigate towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, and then navigate towards the delivery cell to deliver the parcel.

2024-11-07 18:42:19,245 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error received seems to be a timeout error, suggesting that the function might be running into an infinite loop of actions. In this case, the agent was executing the action_2 repeatedly even after reaching the desired coordinates, which led to a timeout error. The agent's short term goal was to navigate towards the nearest battery, pick it up, then navigate towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, and finally move towards the delivery cell and deliver the parcel. This error can be avoided in the future by adding a condition to break the loop once the agent reaches the desired coordinates. Also, it would be beneficial to add some error handling to catch any unexpected situations and prevent infinite loops. Furthermore, consider adding a limit to the number of moves the agent can make, to prevent it from getting stuck in an infinite loop if it cannot reach its destination.

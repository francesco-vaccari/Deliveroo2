The agent has only moved closer to the key but hasn't picked it up nor unlocked the door. For future plan generation, the agent needs to ensure that it includes actions to pick up the key when it reaches the same coordinates as the key. Furthermore, the agent must include actions to move towards the door after picking up the key, and then unlock the door. This suggests that the plan generator needs to consider the full sequence of actions required to achieve the goal, and not just the initial movement towards the goal. This information should be stored in the agent's memory to improve future plan generation and execution.

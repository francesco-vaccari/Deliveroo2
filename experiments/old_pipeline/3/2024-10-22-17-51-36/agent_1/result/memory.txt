- The agent failed to achieve its short term goal. The agent has only moved closer to the key but hasn't picked it up nor unlocked the door. For future plan generation, the agent needs to ensure that it includes actions to pick up the key when it reaches the same coordinates as the key. Furthermore, the agent must include actions to move towards the door after picking up the key, and then unlock the door. This suggests that the plan generator needs to consider the full sequence of actions required to achieve the goal, and not just the initial movement towards the goal. This information should be stored in the agent's memory to improve future plan generation and execution.
- The agent successfully achieved its short term goal. It first picked up the key, then moved to the door and unlocked it. This suggests that the plan generator correctly considered the full sequence of actions required and executed them in the correct order. In future, the agent should continue to ensure that all necessary actions for goal completion are included in the plan and executed in the correct sequence. This successful execution should be stored in the agent's memory to improve future plan generation and execution.
- The agent successfully achieved its short term goal of picking up the parcel and delivering it to the nearest delivery cell. This suggests that the plan generator correctly considered the full sequence of actions required and executed them in the correct order. The agent should continue to plan and execute actions in a way that minimizes the distance travelled. In future, the agent should also consider the type of cells in its path. This successful execution should be stored in the agent's memory to improve future plan generation and execution.

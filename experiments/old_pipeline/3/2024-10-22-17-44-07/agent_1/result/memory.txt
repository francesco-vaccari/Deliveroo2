- The agent has not achieved its short term goal of moving towards the parcel and picking it up. The agent only moved towards the parcel but did not pick it up. Future plans should include an action to pick up the parcel after moving towards it. Also, it is important to ensure that the agent has met the preconditions for picking up the parcel, such as being in the same coordinates as the parcel.
- 
- The agent has not achieved the short term goal of delivering the parcel as indicated by the agent's score remaining unchanged at 0. The agent should ensure the parcel reaches a delivery cell for the goal to be achieved. This can be done by planning a path towards the delivery cell. The agent should also consider that actions may fail if their preconditions are not met in the environment, therefore the agent should check for these preconditions before executing an action. Additionally, the agent should take into consideration the type of cells in its path, avoiding non-walkable cells when planning its route.
- 
- The agent failed to achieve its short term goal of delivering the parcel. Plan execution did not result in any changes to the agent's state or the environment. In the future, ensure that the actions in the plan lead to progress towards the goal. Consider using actions that move the agent closer to the delivery cell or actions that deliver the parcel if the agent is already at the delivery cell.
- The agent failed to achieve its short term goal of delivering the parcel. The agent moved but dropped the parcel before reaching the delivery cell. In the future, ensure that the actions in the plan lead to progress towards the goal. The agent should hold on to the parcel until it reaches the delivery cell. Consider using actions that move the agent closer to the delivery cell or actions that deliver the parcel if the agent is already at the delivery cell.
- The agent failed to achieve its short term goal of delivering the parcel. The agent moved towards the parcel, picked it up and then moved again, however, it did not reach the delivery cell. The agent should ensure not to drop the parcel before reaching the delivery cell. Ensure the plan includes steps to get the agent to the delivery cell. The actions 'action_5' and 'action_4' were effective in moving the agent and picking up the parcel, but further actions are needed to ensure delivery. In the future, ensure that the actions in the plan lead to progress towards the goal and the agent reaches the delivery cell.
- 
- The agent successfully moved to a new cell, proving that the plan generation was effective in this case. It's important to continue monitoring the agent's movements to make further improvements. Any issues in the movement might be due to changes in the environment that were not taken into account in the plan. Therefore, updating the belief set frequently is crucial for plan generation. Also, the agent needs to consider objects on the cell during the plan generation phase to avoid any unexpected events.
- The agent successfully delivered a parcel, which indicates that the plan generation and execution were effective in this case. It's important to continue monitoring the agent's successful deliveries to make further improvements. The agent also needs to consider the types of cells during the plan generation phase, as certain types, like 'double_delivery_cell', can provide additional benefits. Additionally, the agent lost the key after the delivery, which could be a potential issue in future tasks. Therefore, the agent should consider the consequences of actions on its resources during the plan generation phase.

Moreover, the agent has also picked up a key, which suggests that the environment may contain doors that need to be unlocked. The plan should account for this and include steps to use the key to unlock doors if necessary. The agent's score remains unchanged indicating that picking up parcels or keys does not contribute to the score. Only successful delivery of parcels should be considered as the main goal.

This indicates that the plan was incomplete. In future, the plan should include steps for the agent to navigate to the delivery cell after picking up the parcel. Moreover, the agent has also picked up a key, which suggests that the environment may contain doors that need to be unlocked. The plan should account for this and include steps to use the key to unlock doors if necessary. The agent's score remains unchanged indicating that picking up parcels or keys does not contribute to the score. Only successful delivery of parcels should be considered as the main goal. Additionally, the agent needs to execute more actions within the plan, as the current plan only included a single action 'action_2'. This could be the reason why the agent did not achieve the short term goal. The plan generation needs to consider the full path to the delivery cell, including all necessary actions to get there.

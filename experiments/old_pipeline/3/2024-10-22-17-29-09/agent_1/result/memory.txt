- The agent is capable of successfully navigating to the parcel spawn point and picking up the parcel. This demonstrates that the agent has an understanding of the environment's layout and is able to interact with objects within the environment. Future plan generation should consider the layout of the environment and the positions of objects within the environment. It's also important to ensure that the agent has the necessary abilities to interact with these objects.

This suggests that the agent might need to understand better the requirements of delivering parcels, such as going to the correct delivery cell and performing the correct action to drop off the parcel. Future plans should include actions that ensure the parcel is successfully delivered to the delivery cell.

Future plans should include actions that ensure the parcel is successfully delivered to the delivery cell. In this instance, the agent did not perform any action that would lead to achieving the short term goal. The plan generation needs to include actions that are directly related to the goal. The agent should pick up the parcel, navigate to the delivery cell and perform the drop off action in order to achieve the goal. It is also important to handle events that might interfere with the execution of the plan.

It is also important to handle events that might interfere with the execution of the plan. The absence of actions in the executed plan indicates that the planning process might be failing or not generating the required actions to achieve the desired goals. Future plan generation should include a verification step to ensure that the generated plan contains the necessary actions to achieve the goal.

- The agent was successful in picking up the parcel, however, it failed to deliver the parcel to the nearest delivery cell. This indicates that the plan was incomplete. In future, the plan should include steps for the agent to navigate to the delivery cell after picking up the parcel. Moreover, the agent has also picked up a key, which suggests that the environment may contain doors that need to be unlocked. The plan should account for this and include steps to use the key to unlock doors if necessary. The agent's score remains unchanged indicating that picking up parcels or keys does not contribute to the score. Only successful delivery of parcels should be considered as the main goal.

The agent's score remains unchanged indicating that picking up parcels or keys does not contribute to the score. Only successful delivery of parcels should be considered as the main goal. Additionally, the agent needs to execute more actions within the plan, as the current plan only included a single action 'action_2'. This could be the reason why the agent did not achieve the short term goal. The plan generation needs to consider the full path to the delivery cell, including all necessary actions to get there.
- 
- The agent successfully executed the plan to navigate to the delivery cell and put down the parcel. The agent should continue executing similar plans, ensuring to validate preconditions for actions to maintain the success rate.

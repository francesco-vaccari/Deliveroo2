[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"function": "def update_belief_set(event, belief_set):\n    if event['event_type'] == 'object added':\n        if 'map' not in belief_set:\n            belief_set['map'] = {}\n        belief_set['map'][event['object_type']] = event['object']\n    elif event['event_type'] == 'object changed':\n        if 'map' in belief_set and event['object_type'] in belief_set['map']:\n            belief_set['map'][event['object_type']].update(event['object'])\n    elif event['event_type'] == 'object removed':\n        if 'map' in belief_set and event['object_type'] in belief_set['map']:\n            del belief_set['map'][event['object_type']]\n    return belief_set"}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. You MUST access directly the 'belief_set' if you need to check the state of the environment. Accessing the 'belief_set' through other variables will NOT work as the other variables will NOT be updated as the 'belief_set' is updated.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to pick up a parcel if it is in the same cell as the parcel, and to move towards the delivery cell if it is carrying a parcel. If the agent is not carrying a parcel, it should move towards the nearest parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "information": "The agent has successfully picked up the parcel, but it has not moved towards the delivery cell.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. You MUST access directly the 'belief_set' if you need to check the state of the environment. Accessing the 'belief_set' through other variables will NOT work as the other variables will NOT be updated as the 'belief_set' is updated.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The agent has successfully picked up the parcel, but it has not moved towards the delivery cell. To improve plan generation, the agent should ensure that it includes actions to move towards the delivery cell after picking up a parcel. Moreover, the agent should be programmed to monitor its location and the location of the delivery cell in order to align its movements appropriately.

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. You MUST access directly the 'belief_set' if you need to check the state of the environment. Accessing the 'belief_set' through other variables will NOT work as the other variables will NOT be updated as the 'belief_set' is updated.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to detect if the agent is carrying a parcel and if so, deliver it to the nearest delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 20}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 20}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.

[CONTROL Q5]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the environment, collect all available parcels, and deliver them to the designated delivery cells to maximize its score.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}}


This is the belief set of the agent after having pursued the goal:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 20}}}


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The agent was able to successfully deliver a parcel to the delivery cell. This indicates that the agent's pathfinding and parcel delivery processes are functioning properly. Keep in mind the environment's layout and objects' locations when generating plans to ensure efficient paths and successful deliveries.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the environment, collect all available parcels, and deliver them to the designated delivery cells to maximize its score.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 20}}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The agent was able to successfully deliver a parcel to the delivery cell. This indicates that the agent's pathfinding and parcel delivery processes are functioning properly. Keep in mind the environment's layout and objects' locations when generating plans to ensure efficient paths and successful deliveries.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"function": "def should_pursue_goal(belief_set):\n    # If there are parcels in the environment or the agent is carrying parcels, the goal should be pursued\n    if 'parcel' in belief_set and belief_set['parcel'] != {}:\n        return True\n    elif belief_set['agent'][1]['parcels_carried_ids'] != []:\n        return True\n    # If there are no parcels and the agent is not carrying any, the goal should not be pursued\n    else:\n        return False"}

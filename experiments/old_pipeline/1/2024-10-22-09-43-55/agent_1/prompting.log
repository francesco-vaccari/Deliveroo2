[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'agent' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'agent'.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Accessing directly the 'belief_set' is strongly suggested. Copying objects from the belief set to local variables will not work as the local variable is not a reference and won't be updated as the belief set is updated. Given the example 'abc = belief_set["key"]', 'abc' will not be updated as 'belief_set["key"]' is updated.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the parcel spawn point and pick up a parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}
- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "True", "information": "The agent is capable of efficiently navigating towards the parcel spawn point, and successfully picking up a parcel when it reaches the spawn point.

- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the delivery cell and deliver the parcel it is carrying

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The agent is capable of efficiently navigating towards the parcel spawn point, and successfully picking up a parcel when it reaches the spawn point. For future plan generation, it should continue using similar actions to navigate towards the parcel spawn point and pick up parcels. It is also important to ensure that the agent is aware of the current location of parcels and its own location to make efficient movements. Monitoring the 'object changed' events can help the agent keep track of these changes.

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently pick up and deliver as many parcels as possible, maximizing its overall score while minimizing the distance traveled.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the parcel spawn point and pick up a parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Accessing directly the 'belief_set' is strongly suggested. Copying objects from the belief set to local variables will not work as the local variable is not a reference and won't be updated as the belief set is updated. Given the example 'abc = belief_set["key"]', 'abc' will not be updated as 'belief_set["key"]' is updated.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

The agent is capable of efficiently navigating towards the parcel spawn point, and successfully picking up a parcel when it reaches the spawn point.

You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Consider the following belief set in json format:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}

Provide a long term goal description in natural language:
- do not reference specific instances of the belief set
- keep it general, abstract and high level
- keep it brief (1-2 sentences)

The long term goal you have to provide should be different from the ones already implemented. These are the descriptions of the already implemented long term goals:
No long term goal has been implemented yet.


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The memory is currently empty.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the description.
Temperature: 0.7

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to optimize its path in the environment to collect and deliver as many parcels as possible within a given time frame.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the parcel spawn point and pick up a parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Accessing directly the 'belief_set' is strongly suggested. Copying objects from the belief set to local variables will not work as the local variable is not a reference and won't be updated as the belief set is updated. Given the example 'abc = belief_set["key"]', 'abc' will not be updated as 'belief_set["key"]' is updated.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The memory is currently empty.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to deliver the parcel it is carrying to the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'score': 0}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 20}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 20, 'has_key': False}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "True", "information": "The agent has successfully delivered a parcel, indicating that it can navigate to the delivery cell and perform the delivery action. This suggests that the agent's planning and execution capabilities are effective in navigating the map and completing delivery tasks. The agent should continue to refine its ability to navigate and deliver parcels effectively, especially considering potential obstacles or changes in the environment."}

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent's long term goal is to optimize its path in the environment to collect and deliver as many parcels as possible within a given time frame.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 20, 'has_key': False}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The agent has successfully delivered a parcel, indicating that it can navigate to the delivery cell and perform the delivery action. This suggests that the agent's planning and execution capabilities are effective in navigating the map and completing delivery tasks.

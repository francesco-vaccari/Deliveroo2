- The agent is capable of efficiently navigating towards the parcel spawn point, and successfully picking up a parcel when it reaches the spawn point. For future plan generation, it should continue using similar actions to navigate towards the parcel spawn point and pick up parcels. It is also important to ensure that the agent is aware of the current location of parcels and its own location to make efficient movements. Monitoring the 'object changed' events can help the agent keep track of these changes.

Monitoring the 'object changed' events can help the agent keep track of these changes. The agent has not reached the delivery cell yet, so it has not achieved the short term goal. For future plans, the agent should generate a plan that includes actions to move towards the delivery cell after picking up a parcel.

For future plans, the agent should generate a plan that includes actions to move towards the delivery cell after picking up a parcel. The agent also needs to include actions to drop off parcels at the delivery cell in its plan. This will help it achieve its short term goal of increasing its score by delivering parcels.

- The agent has successfully delivered a parcel, indicating that it can navigate to the delivery cell and perform the delivery action. This suggests that the agent's planning and execution capabilities are effective in navigating the map and completing delivery tasks. The agent should continue to refine its ability to navigate and deliver parcels effectively, especially considering potential obstacles or changes in the environment.

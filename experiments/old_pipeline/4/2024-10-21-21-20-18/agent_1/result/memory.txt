- The agent successfully picked up a key but failed to pick up a parcel. To improve plan generation, ensure that the agent's plan includes actions for retrieving both the key and the parcel if they are present in the same cell. Also, remember that actions can fail if their preconditions are not met, so the agent should have a clear understanding of the environment and the state of the objects before performing an action.

- The plan generation was effective in achieving the short-term goal of picking up a parcel at the agent's coordinates. It is important to ensure the agent is at the same coordinates as the parcel before attempting to pick it up. This can be guaranteed by including a check in the plan generation process to confirm the agent's coordinates match the parcel's before the pick up action is performed.

However, the agent was not successful in reaching the delivery cell while carrying the parcel. The agent should also avoid non-walkable cells in its movement towards the delivery cell. If there is a door in the path, the agent should use the key to open it. The plan generation process should therefore include actions to navigate around non-walkable cells and to use the key when a door is encountered.

- Delivering a parcel to a delivery cell leads to an increase in score, and the parcel is removed from the environment. The key carried by the agent is also lost during this action. In order to improve plan generation, ensure the agent has a key before attempting to deliver a parcel. Furthermore, consider the position of the delivery cells and the walkable paths when planning the delivery route.

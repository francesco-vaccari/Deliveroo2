- The agent failed to pick up the key. It moved towards the key but did not perform the action to pick it up. In the future, ensure that the plan includes an action to pick up the key once the agent has reached the key's coordinates. Also, monitor the events received after each action to verify if the action was successful and adjust the plan if necessary.
- The agent successfully picked up the key. This indicates that the agent can perform actions correctly when it is at the required coordinates. The agent's plan generation and execution seems to be improving. Continue to monitor the events received after each action to verify if the action was successful and adjust the plan if necessary.
- The agent successfully picked up the key. This indicates that the agent can perform actions correctly when it is at the required coordinates. The agent's plan generation and execution seems to be improving. Continue to monitor the events received after each action to verify if the action was successful and adjust the plan if necessary. However, the agent has not reached the delivery cell. The plan generation should consider the agent's current position and the position of the delivery cell to generate a path that the agent can follow. It should also consider the type of each cell in the path to make sure that the agent can move through it. If the path contains a door and the agent has a key, the agent should use the key to open the door. If the path contains a door and the agent does not have a key, the agent should find a key before proceeding with the delivery.
- The agent successfully delivered the parcel and achieved the short term goal. This indicates that the agent is able to manipulate objects in the environment and perform complex actions. The agent's plan generation and execution seems to be improving. Continue to monitor the events received after each action to verify if the action was successful and adjust the plan if necessary. The agent's current position, the position of the delivery cell and the type of each cell in the path continue to be important factors in plan generation. The agent was able to unlock doors when necessary. The key appears to be a valuable resource that the agent should aim to acquire when a door is in the path.

Additionally, the agent should account for the possibility of the 'move' action failing and implement a recovery strategy, such as attempting the move again or choosing a different path. It is noticeable from the recent execution that actions may not always result in changes to the environment or agent's state. In such cases, the agent should be capable of re-evaluating its plan or generating a new one if needed. The agent should also ensure that it has a sufficient understanding of the environment before executing the plan. The agent should also consider increasing the number of actions in its plan or introduce more variety in actions to increase the chance of success.
2024-10-21 21:09:56,211 - INFO - [LOOP] Memory update: The agent has not reached the delivery cell yet, thus the parcel has not been delivered. The agent should continue its navigation towards the delivery cell and perform the 'delivery' action once it reaches there. It is also crucial to remember that some cells may be non-walkable or blocked by doors. In such cases, the agent should take alternative paths if available or use the 'key' to open the doors. This strategy will ensure the agent successfully delivers the parcels in future attempts.

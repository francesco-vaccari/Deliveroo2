- The agent successfully completed the short term objective of finding and picking up the key. This suggests that the agent is capable of navigating the environment to find objects and pick them up. In the future, the agent should continue with similar actions when the goal is to find and pick up specific items in the environment. The agent should also be aware of the conditions required to execute an action successfully. For instance, the agent needs to be in the same coordinates as the object to pick it up.
- The agent successfully moved towards the parcel but failed to pick it up. The agent needs to perform a 'pick up' action when it is on the same coordinates as the parcel. This suggests that the agent should not only navigate to the location of the object but also perform the necessary action to interact with it. The agent should check its list of actions and perform the correct one based on its current location and the objects present there. This will help in achieving the goal of picking up objects and moving towards the delivery cell. The agent should also make sure that the path to the delivery cell is walkable, as some cells might be non-walkable, blocking the agent's path.
- The agent successfully moved towards the parcel and picked it up. The agent correctly performed the 'pick up' action when it was on the same coordinates as the parcel. This confirms the previous suggestion that the agent should not only navigate to the location of the object but also perform the necessary action to interact with it. The agent should continue to check its list of actions and perform the correct one based on its current location and the objects present there. This is an effective strategy for achieving the goal of picking up objects and moving towards the delivery cell. The agent should also continue ensuring the path to the delivery cell is walkable, as some cells might be non-walkable, blocking the agent's path. The agent should also consider the 'carry capacity' to ensure it doesn't attempt to pick up more parcels than it can carry.
- The agent has not reached the delivery cell yet, thus the parcel has not been delivered. The agent should continue its navigation towards the delivery cell and perform the 'delivery' action once it reaches there. It is also crucial to remember that some cells may be non-walkable or blocked by doors. In such cases, the agent should take alternative paths if available or use the 'key' to open the doors. This strategy will ensure the agent successfully delivers the parcels in future attempts.

Additionally, the agent should account for the possibility of the 'move' action failing and implement a recovery strategy, such as attempting the move again or choosing a different path.

It is noticeable from the recent execution that actions may not always result in changes to the environment or agent's state. In such cases, the agent should be capable of re-evaluating its plan or generating a new one if needed. The agent should also ensure that it has a sufficient understanding of the environment before executing the plan. The agent should also consider increasing the number of actions in its plan or introduce more variety in actions to increase the chance of success.
- 
- The agent failed to deliver the parcel as it ended up in the same cell where it started and still has the parcel. It seems like some actions were not successful, possibly due to their preconditions not being met. The agent should ensure that the preconditions for an action are met before performing it. Also, the agent might need to consider alternative routes if the planned route contains non-walkable cells. Additionally, the agent should ensure to deliver the parcel if it is standing on a delivery cell.

Also, the agent might need to consider alternative routes if the planned route contains non-walkable cells. Additionally, the agent should ensure to deliver the parcel if it is standing on a delivery cell. Furthermore, in this instance, the agent didn't execute any action during the plan. The agent should ensure that the plan is not empty and contains actions that lead towards the goal.
- 
- The agent did not achieve the short term goal. No action was successful in changing the environment state. The plan needs to be improved by incorporating actions that result in the agent moving towards the delivery cell while carrying the parcel. The agent should also ensure that it has met all the preconditions before performing an action to avoid action failure.
- 
- The agent successfully delivered the parcel and updated its score, but it lost a key in the process. Future plans should aim to conserve valuable resources like keys whenever possible. Delivery actions can lead to losing carried items such as keys. The agent should plan to use keys only when necessary or after the delivery action has been performed.

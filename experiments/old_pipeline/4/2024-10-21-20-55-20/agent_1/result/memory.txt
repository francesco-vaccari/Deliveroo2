- The agent failed to achieve the goal because it did not reach the door after acquiring the key. To improve the plan generation and execution, ensure that the agent moves towards the nearest door after picking up the key. Also, it is crucial to verify that the path to the door is walkable before the agent starts moving towards it. Consider implementing a function to check the walkability of the path before the agent starts moving. This will prevent the agent from getting stuck or losing the key before reaching the door.

- The agent did not achieve the short term goal of picking up the parcel and moving towards the nearest delivery cell. The agent only moved closer to the parcel and did not pick it up. In future plan generation, ensure that the plan includes actions to pick up parcels when the agent is in the same cell as the parcel. Also, make sure to include actions that move the agent towards the nearest delivery cell after picking up a parcel.
- The agent successfully picked up the parcel but did not move towards the nearest delivery cell. The plan should include actions to move the agent towards the delivery cell after picking up a parcel. Also, consider the cell types in the path to the delivery cell during plan generation. The agent should avoid non-walkable cells and use keys where necessary to open doors blocking the path to the delivery cell.

The agent should avoid non-walkable cells and use keys where necessary to open doors blocking the path to the delivery cell. The agent should also consider that delivering the parcel could result in losing the key it is carrying, so plan the actions accordingly to ensure the key is not required after the parcel is delivered.

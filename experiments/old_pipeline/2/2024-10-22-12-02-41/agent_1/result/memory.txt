- The agent can successfully pick up the key when it is on the same cell as the key. This action does not seem to require any specific preconditions and it does not change the agent's location. So, the agent can integrate this action into its plan whenever it is on the same cell as a key and it has not picked up the key yet.

So, the agent can integrate this action into its plan whenever it is on the same cell as a key and it has not picked up the key yet. The agent should also consider the state of the environment as it can impact the success of the plan. A plan might fail to execute if there are non-walkable cells on the path to the goal. The agent should generate a plan considering such features of the environment.
- The agent successfully picked up the parcel when it was on the same cell as the parcel. This action seems to require the agent to be on the same cell as the parcel and does not change the agent's location. Therefore, the agent can integrate this action into its plan whenever it is on the same cell as a parcel and it has not picked up the parcel yet. The agent should continue to consider the state of the environment as it can impact the success of the plan. In addition, the agent needs to be aware of the location of parcels in the environment to successfully achieve its goal.

In addition, the agent needs to be aware of the location of parcels in the environment to successfully achieve its goal. No actions were executed in this plan, which indicates that the agent may have already been in the optimal position to achieve the goal. In future plan generations, the agent should consider its current state and position before executing any unnecessary actions. If the agent is already in the optimal position, no actions need to be taken.

In future plan generations, the agent should consider its current state and position before executing any unnecessary actions. If the agent is already in the optimal position, no actions need to be taken. The agent also successfully moved to cells that contained the desired objects (keys and parcels). The agent's actions of moving resulted in the change of the agent's and the objects' coordinates. Actions that move the agent seem to also move the objects that the agent is carrying. This should be taken into account in future plan generations. If the agent needs to carry an object to a specific location, the agent can plan to move to that location after picking up the object.
- The agent successfully picked up the parcel and the key when it was on the same cell as these objects. This action seems to require the agent to be on the same cell as the objects and does not change the agent's location. Therefore, the agent can integrate this action into its plan whenever it is on the same cell as an object it needs to pick up and it has not picked up the object yet. The agent should continue to consider the state of the environment as it can impact the success of the plan.

- The plan was successful in achieving the goal of delivering the parcel. From the executed plan, it is inferred that the agent can carry the parcel and the key together, and that the parcel disappears from the environment when delivered. Also, the agent loses the key when it delivers a parcel. This information can be used in future plan generation to ensure the agent has a key before attempting to deliver a parcel.

This action seems to require the agent to be on the same cell as the parcel and does not change the agent's location. Therefore, the agent can integrate this action into its plan whenever it is on the same cell as a parcel and it has not picked up the parcel yet. The agent should continue to consider the state of the environment as it can impact the success of the plan. In addition, the agent needs to be aware of the location of parcels in the environment to successfully achieve its goal. No actions were executed in this plan, which indicates that the agent may have already been in the optimal position to achieve the goal. In future plan generations, the agent should consider its current state and position before executing any unnecessary actions. If the agent is already in the optimal position, no actions need to be taken. The agent also successfully moved to cells that contained the desired objects (keys and parcels). The agent's actions of moving resulted in the change of the agent's and the objects' coordinates. Actions that move the agent seem to also move the objects that the agent is carrying. This should be taken into account in future plan generations. If the agent needs to carry an object to a specific location, the agent can plan to move to that location after picking up the object.

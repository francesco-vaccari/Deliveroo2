- The agent did not achieve the short term goal as it failed to pick up the parcel. It only moved towards the parcel spawn cell but did not pick up the parcel. In future plan generations, ensure that the plan includes actions for picking up the parcel after reaching the parcel spawn cell. Also, consider adding checks to verify if each action was successful before proceeding to the next action.
- The agent successfully achieved the short term goal of moving to the parcel spawn cell and picking up the parcel. In future plan generations, continue to include actions for picking up the parcel after reaching the parcel spawn cell. Also, the agent should continue to receive feedback after each action to verify its success before proceeding to the next action. This feedback mechanism proved effective in this instance.

Also, the agent should continue to receive feedback after each action to verify its success before proceeding to the next action. This feedback mechanism proved effective in this instance. However, the agent failed to deliver the parcel. The agent should include actions in the plan to move to the delivery cell and then put down the parcel. Furthermore, it should be ensured that the agent's path to the delivery cell is clear and walkable.

- The agent can successfully pick up the key when it is in the same cell. The agent needs to perform action_1 to move to the cell where the key is located, then perform action_5 to pick up the key. This sequence of actions should be considered when generating plans to achieve the goal of picking up keys.
- The agent can successfully deliver a parcel when it reaches the delivery cell. The agent needs to perform a sequence of move actions (action_2, action_4) to reach the delivery cell carrying the parcel, then perform action_6 to deliver the parcel. This sequence of actions should be considered when generating plans to achieve the goal of delivering parcels. Moreover, it is noted that the agent loses the key when it delivers a parcel, this should be taken into consideration in the plan generation. The agent should ensure that all doors are opened before delivering the parcel if the key is needed for other actions.

- The agent failed to reach the delivery cell and drop off the parcel. In future, the plan should include actions to navigate to the delivery cell and drop off the parcel. The agent should also ensure that it is carrying the parcel before attempting to deliver it. The agent should update its belief set after each action to reflect the changes in the environment.
- 
- The agent has achieved the short term goal of moving to a cell that contains a parcel and picking up the parcel. In future plans, ensure that the agent's actions successfully alter the state of the environment, and that each action leads to the achievement of the short term goal. Monitor the events and the agent's belief set before and after executing the plan to confirm that the actions are leading towards the goal. If an action does not change the state as expected, investigate the possible causes.
- The agent has not achieved the short term goal of delivering the parcel to the nearest delivery cell. The agent's position and the parcel's status have not changed after executing the plan. In future plans, the agent should include actions that move towards the delivery cell while avoiding non-walkable cells. If actions are not causing the expected change, it is necessary to reevaluate the plan and the conditions under which these actions are selected. The agent should also validate the preconditions of an action before its execution to ensure its success.

If actions are not causing the expected change, it is necessary to reevaluate the plan and the conditions under which these actions are selected. The agent should also validate the preconditions of an action before its execution to ensure its success. No meaningful events were returned after the last action which suggests that either the action failed or it didn't cause any change in the environment. This information can be used in the future for better plan generation and execution.
- 
- The agent has moved closer to the delivery cell while carrying a parcel, but has not yet reached it. In future plans, ensure that the agent has a clear path to the delivery cell and that it continues to move towards it until it reaches the cell. Be aware of non-walkable cells that may obstruct the agent's path.
- 
- The agent has not moved from its initial position, therefore it has not achieved the short term goal. To improve plan generation, the agent should ensure that it includes actions that move the agent towards the delivery cell. The agent should also consider that it needs to pickup keys to open doors, and plan accordingly. Moreover, the agent should validate that the actions it plans to perform can be executed given the current state of the environment.

Moreover, the agent should validate that the actions it plans to perform can be executed given the current state of the environment. Additionally, it seems that the agent is not receiving any events after executing actions, this could mean that the actions are not having any effect on the environment, or that the agent is not perceiving the changes correctly. This should be investigated further.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"function": "def update_belief_set(event, belief_set):\n    if event['object_type'] == 'map':\n        if event['event_type'] == 'object added':\n            belief_set['map'] = event['object']\n        elif event['event_type'] == 'object changed':\n            belief_set['map'].update(event['object'])\n        elif event['event_type'] == 'object removed':\n            belief_set.pop('map')\n    return belief_set"}

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short-term goal is to deliver the parcel the agent is currently carrying by navigating to the delivery cell and dropping off the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "information": "The agent failed to reach the delivery cell and drop off the parcel.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The memory is currently empty.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell that contains a parcel and pick up the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "True", "information": "The agent has achieved the short term goal of moving to a cell that contains a parcel and picking up the parcel.

The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The agent has achieved the short term goal of moving to a cell that contains a parcel and picking up the parcel. In future plans, ensure that the agent's actions successfully alter the state of the environment, and that each action leads to the achievement of the short term goal. Monitor the events and the agent's belief set before and after executing the plan to confirm that the actions are leading towards the goal. If an action does not change the state as expected, investigate the possible causes.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to deliver the parcel to the nearest delivery cell by avoiding non-walkable cells.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the delivery cell while carrying a parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "information": "The agent has moved closer to the delivery cell while carrying a parcel, but has not yet reached it.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the delivery cell, and if it encounters a parcel or a key on the way, it should pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The memory is currently empty.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "information": "The agent has not moved from its initial position, therefore it has not achieved the short term goal.

- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell that contains a parcel and pick up the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


The agent has learned the following information, you can use this information to provide a better response:
The agent has not moved from its initial position, therefore it has not achieved the short term goal. To improve plan generation, the agent should ensure that it includes actions that move the agent towards the delivery cell. The agent should also consider that it needs to pickup keys to open doors, and plan accordingly. Moreover, the agent should validate that the actions it plans to perform can be executed given the current state of the environment.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

[CONTROL Q4]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move to the cell that contains the parcel, pick up the parcel, and then move towards the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_2 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'parcel': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'key': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'door': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.



You also need to infer information from the given data that can be used to improve plan generation in the future. This information should be general and not refer to specific instances of objects in the environment. Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you should write suggestions on how to improve the plan generation and execution; you can refer to the name of the actions. 
All this information will be stored in the agent's memory, you need to integrate the informationthat you write now with the information that is already stored in the agent's memory. This is the current information stored in the agent's memory:
The agent has not moved from its initial position, therefore it has not achieved the short term goal. To improve plan generation, the agent should ensure that it includes actions that move the agent towards the delivery cell. The agent should also consider that it needs to pickup keys to open doors, and plan accordingly. Moreover, the agent should validate that the actions it plans to perform can be executed given the current state of the environment.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False', and the field 'information' containing the information that you want to store in the agent's memory.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "information": "The agent has not moved from its initial position, therefore it has not achieved the short term goal. To improve plan generation, the agent should ensure that it includes actions that move the agent towards the delivery cell. The agent should also consider that it needs to pickup keys to open doors, and plan accordingly. Moreover, the agent should validate that the actions it plans to perform can be executed given the current state of the environment. Additionally, it seems that the agent is not receiving any events after executing actions, this could mean that the actions are not having any effect on the environment, or that the agent is not perceiving the changes correctly. This should be investigated further."}

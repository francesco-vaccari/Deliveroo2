- The agent was trying to achieve the short term goal of delivering a parcel to the nearest delivery cell. The error that occurred was due to a timeout after 15 seconds, indicating the function likely entered an infinite loop. This could have been due to the agent constantly trying to move in one direction (action_4) without updating its position or checking if it had reached its destination. In the future, ensure that the agent's position is updated after every action and that it checks whether it has reached its destination before performing the next action. This can be achieved by adding condition checks in the while loop and updating the agent's coordinates after each action. Also, consider adding a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.

- The error occurred due to a timeout, which usually indicates an infinite loop in the function. The agent was trying to navigate to the nearest key, pick it up and move towards the nearest locked door. However, the agent's position was not being updated in the function after each move. This can be avoided by updating the agent_coordinates after each call to function_1, function_2, function_3, or function_4. This will ensure that the while loop eventually terminates once the agent reaches the destination coordinates. Another suggestion is to add a condition to break the loop if it runs for an excessively long duration to avoid infinite loops. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include checks to ensure that the target (key or door) coordinates are reachable and exist on the map. The agent should also check if it has picked up the key before trying to unlock the door.
- The agent has not achieved the short term goal. Even though the agent has picked up the key, it has not moved towards the nearest locked door to open it. The agent's coordinates remain the same before and after executing the plan, meaning it hasn't moved. The plan needs to include actions that make the agent move to the location of the nearest locked door. It also needs to ensure that the agent's path doesn't contain any obstacles that it can't overcome. The agent should also keep updating its belief set with the latest changes in the environment to make informed decisions.
- The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest locked door and open it using the key it is carrying. After executing the plan, the agent's position is [2, 3], while the nearest door is at either [0, 2] or [1, 2] or [1, 3]. The plan only contained one action, which moved the agent one step, but it did not reach the door nor did it open it. Plan generation can be improved by ensuring that the agent moves towards the door until it reaches it, and then performs an action to open the door. The generated plan should contain actions that would result in the agent's position being the same as the door's coordinates, and the door should be removed from the belief set to indicate that it was opened.

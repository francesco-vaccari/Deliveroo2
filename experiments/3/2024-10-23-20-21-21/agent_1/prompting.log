[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate to the nearest parcel and pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent did not achieve its goal of picking up the nearest parcel. The agent moved closer to the parcel but did not perform an action to pick it up. The plan needs to include an action to pick up the parcel once the agent has navigated to it. Also, the agent should verify that it is in the correct location before attempting to pick up the parcel."}

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to navigate towards the available parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.

Response: {"suggestions": "The error encountered was a timeout error. This typically occurs when the agent enters an infinite loop of actions that it doesn't exit within the time limit. In this case, the agent's short term goal was to navigate to an available parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell. The infinite loop was likely caused by the agent being unable to reach the parcel or delivery cell due to being stuck in a loop of the same action - decreasing its second coordinate by 1. To avoid this in the future, checks should be added to verify the agent is making progress towards its goal and isn't stuck in a loop of the same action. Additionally, the agent's movement logic could be updated to take into account the entire map structure and obstacles, such as doors or non-walkable cells, to plan a valid path to its goal."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error encountered was a timeout error. This typically occurs when the agent enters an infinite loop of actions that it doesn't exit within the time limit. In this case, the agent's short term goal was to navigate to an available parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell. The infinite loop was likely caused by the agent being unable to reach the parcel or delivery cell due to being stuck in a loop of the same action - decreasing its second coordinate by 1. To avoid this in the future, checks should be added to verify the agent is making progress towards its goal and isn't stuck in a loop of the same action. Additionally, the agent's movement logic could be updated to take into account the entire map structure and obstacles, such as doors or non-walkable cells, to plan a valid path to its goal.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate to an available parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell while avoiding entering an infinite loop of actions.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The goal of the agent was to navigate to an available parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell while avoiding an infinite loop of actions. Based on the events received after the actions, the agent successfully picked up the parcel. However, the agent did not move towards the delivery cell, as its coordinates have not changed in the belief set. An improvement in the plan generation could be to include actions that move the agent towards the delivery cell after picking up a parcel. The agent could use a pathfinding algorithm to determine the shortest route from its current position to the delivery cell, avoiding any obstacles such as doors or non-walkable cells."}

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error that occurred was a timeout error, which typically indicates that the function entered an infinite loop. In this case, the agent kept executing action_2, which moves the agent by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1. This happened because the agent never reached the key's coordinates. This might be due to the fact that the key was placed at a higher second coordinate, and the function was only increasing the first coordinate of the agent's position. A suggestion to avoid this in the future is to implement a check to make sure the agent is not stuck in an infinite loop. If the agent's position does not change after a certain number of actions, then the function should terminate and return an error message. Additionally, the function could be improved by updating the agent's position in both the x and y directions, not just in the x direction. This would allow the agent to reach the key regardless of its position. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move to the cell with the key and pick it up."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error that occurred was a timeout error, which typically indicates that the function entered an infinite loop. In this case, the agent kept executing action_2, which moves the agent by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1. This happened because the agent never reached the key's coordinates. This might be due to the fact that the key was placed at a higher second coordinate, and the function was only increasing the first coordinate of the agent's position. A suggestion to avoid this in the future is to implement a check to make sure the agent is not stuck in an infinite loop. If the agent's position does not change after a certain number of actions, then the function should terminate and return an error message. Additionally, the function could be improved by updating the agent's position in both the x and y directions, not just in the x direction. This would allow the agent to reach the key regardless of its position. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move to the cell with the key and pick it up.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to locate and move to the cell containing the key, and then pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...



Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short-term goal of the agent is to deliver the parcels it's carrying to the nearest delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to locate and move to the cell containing the key, and then pick it up.
- function_12()	Description: The short-term goal of the agent is to deliver the parcels it's carrying to the nearest delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to locate the nearest parcel, move to it, pick it up and then deliver it to the nearest delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

The plan was empty: no actions executed and no events received.


The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_11()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to locate and move to the cell containing the key, and then pick it up.
- function_12()	Description: The short-term goal of the agent is to deliver the parcels it's carrying to the nearest delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal of the agent is to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn point and pick up any parcels available there.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_14()	Description: The short term goal of the agent is to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn point and pick up any parcels available there.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 40}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_3 , Events received:

Your task is to make suggestinos on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Response: {"suggestions": "The error was a timeout error, typically indicating an infinite loop in the function execution. In this case, the agent was continuously executing the function 'action_3' without updating its belief about its current coordinates, which suggests that the agent wasn't effectively moving. To avoid such errors in the future, it is crucial to ensure that the agent's actions are indeed changing the environment in the expected way. If an action doesn't lead to the expected change, the agent needs to reconsider its plan. Additionally, it's important to include safety checks in the function to prevent infinite loops. This can be done by setting a limit on the number of iterations or by checking if the agent's state hasn't changed over several iterations.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal of the agent is to navigate towards the key, pick it up, and then navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn point and pick up any parcels available there. It should then deliver the parcels to the nearest delivery cell. To prevent infinite loops, the agent should stop its current plan if it has not reached its destination after a certain number of steps.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 40}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 2]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': True, 'score': 40}}

The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The short term goal of the agent was to navigate to the key, pick it up, then navigate to the nearest parcel spawn point, pick up any parcels, and finally deliver the parcels to the nearest delivery cell. However, the agent picked up the key and reached the parcel spawn point, but it did not pick up any parcels nor did it deliver any parcels to the delivery cell. The agent should have executed a 'pick up parcel' action when it was at the parcel spawn point and then navigated to the delivery cell to execute a 'deliver parcel' action. The plan generation could be improved by ensuring that the 'pick up parcel' action is included in the plan when the agent is at a parcel spawn point, and the 'deliver parcel' action is included when the agent is at a delivery cell and is carrying a parcel."}

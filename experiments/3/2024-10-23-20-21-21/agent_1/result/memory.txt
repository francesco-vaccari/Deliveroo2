- The agent did not achieve its goal of picking up the nearest parcel. The agent moved closer to the parcel but did not perform an action to pick it up. The plan needs to include an action to pick up the parcel once the agent has navigated to it. Also, the agent should verify that it is in the correct location before attempting to pick up the parcel.

- The error encountered was a timeout error. This typically occurs when the agent enters an infinite loop of actions that it doesn't exit within the time limit. In this case, the agent's short term goal was to navigate to an available parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell. The infinite loop was likely caused by the agent being unable to reach the parcel or delivery cell due to being stuck in a loop of the same action - decreasing its second coordinate by 1. To avoid this in the future, checks should be added to verify the agent is making progress towards its goal and isn't stuck in a loop of the same action. Additionally, the agent's movement logic could be updated to take into account the entire map structure and obstacles, such as doors or non-walkable cells, to plan a valid path to its goal.
- The goal of the agent was to navigate to an available parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell while avoiding an infinite loop of actions. Based on the events received after the actions, the agent successfully picked up the parcel. However, the agent did not move towards the delivery cell, as its coordinates have not changed in the belief set. An improvement in the plan generation could be to include actions that move the agent towards the delivery cell after picking up a parcel. The agent could use a pathfinding algorithm to determine the shortest route from its current position to the delivery cell, avoiding any obstacles such as doors or non-walkable cells.

- The error that occurred was a timeout error, which typically indicates that the function entered an infinite loop. In this case, the agent kept executing action_2, which moves the agent by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1. This happened because the agent never reached the key's coordinates. This might be due to the fact that the key was placed at a higher second coordinate, and the function was only increasing the first coordinate of the agent's position. A suggestion to avoid this in the future is to implement a check to make sure the agent is not stuck in an infinite loop. If the agent's position does not change after a certain number of actions, then the function should terminate and return an error message. Additionally, the function could be improved by updating the agent's position in both the x and y directions, not just in the x direction. This would allow the agent to reach the key regardless of its position. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move to the cell with the key and pick it up.

- The agent hasn't executed any actions, hence hasn't made any progress towards its goal. The agent should start by generating a plan that involves steps to locate the nearest parcel. Once the parcel is located, the agent should move to the parcel's location, pick it up and subsequently plan a route to the nearest delivery cell. Furthermore, the agent should consider any obstacles such as doors in its path and if needed, locate keys to open the doors.

- The error was a timeout error, typically indicating an infinite loop in the function execution. In this case, the agent was continuously executing the function 'action_3' without updating its belief about its current coordinates, which suggests that the agent wasn't effectively moving. To avoid such errors in the future, it is crucial to ensure that the agent's actions are indeed changing the environment in the expected way. If an action doesn't lead to the expected change, the agent needs to reconsider its plan. Additionally, it's important to include safety checks in the function to prevent infinite loops. This can be done by setting a limit on the number of iterations or by checking if the agent's state hasn't changed over several iterations. The short term goal of the agent was to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn point and pick up any parcels available there.
- The short term goal of the agent was to navigate to the key, pick it up, then navigate to the nearest parcel spawn point, pick up any parcels, and finally deliver the parcels to the nearest delivery cell. However, the agent picked up the key and reached the parcel spawn point, but it did not pick up any parcels nor did it deliver any parcels to the delivery cell. The agent should have executed a 'pick up parcel' action when it was at the parcel spawn point and then navigated to the delivery cell to execute a 'deliver parcel' action. The plan generation could be improved by ensuring that the 'pick up parcel' action is included in the plan when the agent is at a parcel spawn point, and the 'deliver parcel' action is included when the agent is at a delivery cell and is carrying a parcel.

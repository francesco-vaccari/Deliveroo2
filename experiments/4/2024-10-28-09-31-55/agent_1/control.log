This is likely causing the agent to be stuck in an infinite loop trying to reach a destination it has already reached, or continuously trying to perform an impossible action.

This could be due to the agent's coordinates not updating in the while loop. The coordinates stored in the 'belief_set' for the agent are not being updated within the function after an action is executed. This is likely causing the agent to be stuck in an infinite loop trying to reach a destination it has already reached, or continuously trying to perform an impossible action. To fix this, ensure that the agent's state in the 'belief_set' is updated after each action, and that there are checks to break the loop if the agent is unable to perform the intended action. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate to the nearest parcel, pick it up if not already carrying one, and then navigate to the nearest delivery cell to drop the parcel off.

This could be due to the fact that the agent is trying to move in a direction that is blocked or not allowed in the environment, thereby causing its coordinate to never change and the loop to continue indefinitely. To avoid this error in the future, perform a check on the validity of the move before executing it. If the move is not valid, choose another direction. Additionally, it may be useful to implement a counter or a maximum number of steps, after which the agent will give up and try a different strategy if it has not reached the target cell. The short term goal of the agent was to find the nearest delivery cell and move towards it in order to deliver the parcel it is currently carrying.

The agent's coordinates after executing the plan are the same as before, indicating that the agent has not moved. It's possible that the actions performed (action_5) are not suitable for this situation. The plan should include actions that actually move the agent towards the delivery cell. The agent could use an algorithm to determine the quickest path to the delivery cell and generate a plan accordingly. The agent should also implement a method to ensure it doesn't get stuck in a loop, such as limiting the number of times a certain action can be repeated in a row.

To avoid such errors in the future, make sure to update the agent's coordinates correctly after each move, add a condition to break the loop if the agent cannot progress further, and consider adding a maximum number of iterations for the while loop to prevent it from running indefinitely.

[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'agent' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'agent'.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'key'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the parcel and pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved the short term goal. The goal was to move towards the parcel and pick it up. However, the agent only moved towards the parcel but did not pick it up. To improve the plan generation, the agent should include an action to pick up the parcel after moving to its location. This could be achieved by checking if the agent's coordinates match the parcel's coordinates and if so, perform the action to pick up the parcel."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to a delivery cell and deliver the parcel it is carrying.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_4 , Events received:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error that occurred was a timeout error. This type of error usually indicates an infinite loop in the function, where the function doesn't terminate due to continuous execution of a loop. In this case, the function contains a while loop that moves the agent towards the closest delivery cell until the agent's coordinates match the delivery cell's. However, it seems that the agent's movement was not properly updated in the belief set, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely. To avoid this error in the future: 1) Ensure that agent's movement is correctly updated in the belief set after each action. 2) Add a condition to break the loop if the agent doesn't move for a certain number of iterations. This will prevent the function from falling into an infinite loop if the agent becomes stuck. 3) The function could also be improved by adding error checking and handling to detect and respond to unexpected situations. 4) Finally, try to avoid designing functions that rely solely on global variables, as these can lead to unexpected behavior if they are not properly maintained. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move to a delivery cell and deliver the parcel it is carrying."}

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to the nearest delivery cell and deliver the parcel it is carrying.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently collect all the parcels and deliver them to the delivery cells while navigating the map, unlocking doors if necessary to reach the destination.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The short term goal of the agent was to move to the nearest delivery cell and deliver the parcel it is carrying. However, the agent is still located at the same coordinates as before the plan execution, and it is no longer carrying the parcel. This indicates that the agent dropped the parcel instead of delivering it. To improve plan generation, the agent should ensure it is in the correct cell (a delivery cell) before attempting to deliver the parcel. Additionally, the agent should check that it still has the parcel before attempting to deliver it.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to the nearest delivery cell by navigating the map and then deliver the parcel it is carrying, ensuring it is in the correct cell before attempting the delivery and also ensuring it still has the parcel before trying to deliver it.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to deliver a parcel by moving to a delivery cell and putting down the parcel it's carrying.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to deliver the parcel it is currently carrying to the nearest delivery cell, if it has one. If the agent doesn't carry a parcel, it should move towards the nearest parcel to pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent did not achieve the short term goal because it did not move from its initial position, hence, it didn't deliver the parcel it was carrying. To improve plan generation, the agent should incorporate actions that move it towards the nearest delivery cell. It can do this by considering the coordinates of the delivery cells in the map and calculating the shortest path to reach them. Also, the agent should incorporate a check to ensure that it is carrying a parcel before attempting to deliver it."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate through the environment, pick up and deliver parcels to their respective delivery cells while also collecting keys to unlock doors when necessary.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library.

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The function was executed repeatedly without updating the agent's position, which led to an infinite loop, causing a timeout error. To avoid this in the future, ensure that the agent's position is updated after every movement action in the function. The agent's position should be consistent with the action executed, for example, if function_4() is executed, the second coordinate of the agent's position should be increased by 1. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to deliver the parcel it was carrying to the closest delivery cell."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_4 , Events received:

After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The agent was trying to achieve the short term goal of delivering a parcel to a delivery cell. The timeout error suggests that the agent probably got stuck in an infinite loop of actions. Looking at the actions executed, the agent only performed 'action_4' multiple times which increases the second coordinate of the agent's position. The agent never changed its first coordinate, which means it was stuck in the same row. This suggests that the condition checks for changing the agent's first coordinate (function_1 and function_2 in the function) might not be working correctly. It is recommended to check these condition checks and ensure that they can change the first coordinate of the agent's position. Additionally, the agent's function could be improved by adding a condition to break the loop if the agent's position does not change after a certain number of iterations, to prevent infinite loops in the future."}

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.

In this case, the agent was trying to deliver a parcel to a delivery cell by adjusting its coordinates. However, it seems the agent was stuck in a loop of actions, moving back and forth between two cells without making progress towards its goal. To avoid this in the future, you could: 1) Implement a check to prevent the agent from moving to a cell it has just left, preventing back-and-forth movements. 2) Implement a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the delivery cell. 3) Add a condition to break the loop if the agent hasn't made progress towards its goal after a certain number of iterations. 4) Make sure the delivery cell is reachable from the agent's current position, considering obstacles and cell types."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The long-term goal is to strategically plan a route that maximizes the agent's overall score, by collecting and delivering as many parcels as possible, and using keys to open doors when it is beneficial.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error that occurred was a timeout error, which usually indicates that the function is stuck in an infinite loop of actions. In this case, the agent was trying to deliver a parcel to a delivery cell by adjusting its coordinates. However, it seems the agent was stuck in a loop of actions, moving back and forth between two cells without making progress towards its goal. To avoid this in the future, you could: 1) Implement a check to prevent the agent from moving to a cell it has just left, preventing back-and-forth movements. 2) Implement a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the delivery cell. 3) Add a condition to break the loop if the agent hasn't made progress towards its goal after a certain number of iterations. 4) Make sure the delivery cell is reachable from the agent's current position, considering obstacles and cell types.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short-term goal is to deliver the parcel that the agent is currently carrying by moving towards the delivery cell, while avoiding back-and-forth movements and checking that the delivery cell is reachable.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.

Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

[CONTROL Q7]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character.

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a key and pick it up. This will allow the agent to unlock doors, giving access to areas required to reach the double points delivery cell.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_2 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}
	- Action: action_4 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}
	- Action: action_2 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}

	None
	- Action: action_2 , Events received:
	None
	Summary of actions executed:
	- Action: action_4, Executed 13 times
	- Action: action_2, Executed 14 times


After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The function used by the agent is causing a timeout error, which indicates that the agent is caught in an infinite loop of actions. This could be due to the agent not updating its belief of its own position after each move, resulting in an endless cycle of movement actions. To avoid this in the future, ensure that the agent's belief of its own position is updated after each move. Additionally, the agent could check if it is making progress towards its goal after each step, and break the loop if it is not. The agent's short term goal was to move to a cell containing a key and pick it up."}

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent is stuck in an infinite loop because the function_1() is called repeatedly without checking whether the agent has reached the boundary of the map. The agent's position does not change when it reaches the boundary, resulting in the function running indefinitely until it times out. To avoid this, before moving the agent, check if the move will result in a valid position within the boundaries of the map. If the move is invalid, choose another direction. Also, always include a termination condition in your loops to prevent them from running indefinitely. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move to the cell containing the closest parcel and pick it up, if the agent is not carrying any parcels.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal of the agent is to move to the cell containing the closest parcel and pick it up if the agent is not carrying any parcels, while ensuring that it does not violate the boundaries of the map.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_23()	Description: The short term goal of the agent is to move to the cell containing the closest parcel and pick it up if the agent is not carrying any parcels, while ensuring that it does not violate the boundaries of the map.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to deliver the parcel the agent is currently carrying to the double points delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved its goal of delivering the parcel to the double points delivery cell. Upon comparing the initial and final belief sets, it is clear that the agent's location and the parcel's status have not changed. The agent performed only one action (action_4) which led to no events. This suggests that either the action failed or it was not the correct action to move the agent towards its goal. To improve plan generation, the agent should consider actions that move it towards the double points delivery cell while carrying the parcel. The agent should also ensure that the chosen actions meet the preconditions required for successful execution."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to carry as many parcels as possible to the double points delivery cell to maximize its score, while also collecting keys to unlock doors whenever necessary.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up a parcel.
- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to a cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_14()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing a parcel and pick it up.
- function_23()	Description: The short term goal of the agent is to move to the cell containing the closest parcel and pick it up if the agent is not carrying any parcels, while ensuring that it does not violate the boundaries of the map.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

[CONTROL Q4]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to pick up the closest parcel if not carrying any parcels, and if carrying a parcel, to deliver it to the nearest delivery cell

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agent': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has picked up the parcel but has not delivered it yet. The agent's plan should have included a step to deliver the parcel once it was picked up. This could be improved by incorporating pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest path to the nearest delivery cell once a parcel has been picked up. Additionally, the agent should update its beliefs about the status of the parcel after picking it up. This would allow the agent to properly plan the next steps to accomplish its goal."}

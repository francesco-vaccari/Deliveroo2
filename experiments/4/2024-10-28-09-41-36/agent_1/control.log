2024-10-28 09:43:44,615 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error that occurred was a timeout error. This type of error usually indicates an infinite loop in the function, where the function doesn't terminate due to continuous execution of a loop. In this case, the function contains a while loop that moves the agent towards the closest delivery cell until the agent's coordinates match the delivery cell's. However, it seems that the agent's movement was not properly updated in the belief set, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely. To avoid this error in the future: 1) Ensure that agent's movement is correctly updated in the belief set after each action. 2) Add a condition to break the loop if the agent doesn't move for a certain number of iterations. This will prevent the function from falling into an infinite loop if the agent becomes stuck. 3) The function could also be improved by adding error checking and handling to detect and respond to unexpected situations. 4) Finally, try to avoid designing functions that rely solely on global variables, as these can lead to unexpected behavior if they are not properly maintained. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move to a delivery cell and deliver the parcel it is carrying.

[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate towards the nearest parcel and pick it up.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved the short term goal of navigating to the nearest parcel and picking it up. The agent has only moved towards the parcel but has not picked it up. A possible improvement to the plan generation could be to add an action to pick up the parcel after reaching its coordinates. This could be done by checking if the agent's coordinates match the parcel's coordinates and if so, perform the 'pick up' action."}

Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up if it is not carrying one already, and then move towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to deliver the parcel that it is currently carrying to the nearest delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_4 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move the agent towards the nearest key, pick it up if not carrying one already, and then move towards the nearest door to unlock it.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to collect all the parcels and deliver them to their respective delivery cells while also collecting keys to unlock doors that might be blocking the path.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error received was a timeout error, which suggests that the problem was related to an infinite loop of actions to execute. Looking at the function implemented, the while loops do not have a proper exit condition, they only rely on the 'has_key' attribute of the agent. If the agent is unable to acquire a key (e.g., if the key is inaccessible), the function will keep running indefinitely, leading to a timeout. One suggestion to avoid this in the future is to implement a maximum number of iterations for the while loop, after which the function should exit even if the agent has not acquired a key. Another suggestion is to include checks and error handling to ensure the agent can reach the key before entering the loop. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest key, pick it up if not carrying one already, and then move towards the nearest door to unlock it.

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest key, pick it up and then move towards the nearest door to unlock it. However, if the agent is unable to acquire a key after a certain number of attempts, it should abandon this goal and instead move towards the nearest parcel.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:

However, if the agent is unable to acquire a key after a certain number of attempts, it should abandon this goal and instead move towards the nearest parcel.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_5 , Events received:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.

Response: {"suggestions": "The error encountered was a timeout error, which suggests that the agent might have been stuck in an infinite loop of actions. The function repeatedly calls function_5() and function_9(), which are wrappers for action_5 (picking up objects) and a short term goal of moving towards parcels. However, the agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest key and pick it up, then move towards the nearest door to unlock it. If the agent is unable to acquire a key after a number of attempts, it should move towards the nearest parcel. The function's logic might not be serving this purpose effectively. To avoid this in the future, ensure that the logic of the function aligns with the intended goal. Add checks to prevent infinite loops by ensuring progress in the agent's actions. Use proper conditional statements to guide the agent's actions based on the environment and its current state. For example, if the agent already has a parcel, there's no need to keep calling function_5(). Moreover, it's not clear what function_9() does, as it seems to perform the same actions as the whole function. Consider revising its usage."}

- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    agent = belief_set['agents'][1]
    key_locations = [key['coordinates'] for key in belief_set['keys'].values() if key['carried_by_id'] is None]
    if not agent['has_key'] and key_locations:
        nearest_key_location = min(key_locations, key=lambda c: abs(c[0] - agent['coordinates'][0]) + abs(c[1] - agent['coordinates'][1]))
        while agent['coordinates'] != nearest_key_location:
            if agent['coordinates'][0] < nearest_key_location[0]:
                function_2()
            elif agent['coordinates'][0] > nearest_key_location[0]:
                function_1()
            if agent['coordinates'][1] < nearest_key_location[1]:
                function_4()
            elif agent['coordinates'][1] > nearest_key_location[1]:
                function_3()
        function_5()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate the agent to the nearest key and pick it up if it does not carry one already. This is to ensure that the agent has the ability to open any doors that may block its path while navigating or making deliveries.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already.
- function_16()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent to the nearest key and pick it up if it does not carry one already. This is to ensure that the agent has the ability to open any doors that may block its path while navigating or making deliveries.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_2 , Events received:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error seems to be a timeout error, which suggests there might be an infinite loop in the function. The function may have been stuck in the 'while' loop because of two reasons: 1. The condition 'agent['coordinates'] != nearest_key_location' never becomes false, possibly because the agent is unable to reach the key's location. This could be due to obstacles or inaccessible paths. The function should account for such situations and break the loop if the agent cannot reach the target location. 2. The agent's coordinates in the belief set aren't updated after executing actions. If the executed actions do not update the agent's coordinates in the belief set, the condition will never be satisfied. To resolve this, ensure that the agent's coordinates are updated in real time in the belief set after executing each action. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate to the nearest key and pick it up if the agent was not already carrying a key."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collect all available parcels and keys, and make successful deliveries to the designated cells, all while maximizing the overall score.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error seems to be a timeout error, which suggests there might be an infinite loop in the function. The function may have been stuck in the 'while' loop because of two reasons: 1. The condition 'agent['coordinates'] != nearest_key_location' never becomes false, possibly because the agent is unable to reach the key's location. This could be due to obstacles or inaccessible paths. The function should account for such situations and break the loop if the agent cannot reach the target location. 2. The agent's coordinates in the belief set aren't updated after executing actions. If the executed actions do not update the agent's coordinates in the belief set, the condition will never be satisfied. To resolve this, ensure that the agent's coordinates are updated in real time in the belief set after executing each action. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate to the nearest key and pick it up if the agent was not already carrying a key.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to navigate towards the nearest key, pick it up if it is not already carrying a key, and to avoid infinite loops by breaking the movement loop if the agent's location does not change after a movement attempt.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [3, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}
- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent failed to pick up the key as per the plan. The agent is currently located at the same coordinates [2,2] as the key, but the 'has_key' attribute of the agent is still False. The plan needs to be modified to include an action for picking up the key when the agent reaches its coordinates. Additionally, the agent needs to ensure that it does not already carry a key before trying to pick up a new one. The agent also needs to employ a mechanism to avoid infinite loops by breaking the movement loop if the agent's location does not change after a movement attempt.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to navigate to the cell containing the key, pick up the key if the agent does not already have one, and avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop by breaking the loop if the agent's location does not change after a movement attempt.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error received was a timeout error, which implies that the function might have gotten caught in an infinite loop. This could occur due to a lack of a proper exit condition in the while loop. If the agent cannot reach the cell it's aiming for, because of obstacles or other reasons, the loop will never terminate. To avoid this, you should add a condition to break the loop if the agent's location does not change after a movement attempt. Also, the agents should be programmed to handle the situation when the destination is unreachable. Alternatively, consider adding a maximum number of iterations for the loop to prevent infinite looping. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up, if it is not carrying one already. If the agent is already carrying a parcel, it was then supposed to head towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel and pick it up if it is not carrying one already. If the agent is already carrying a parcel, it will then head towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel. The function also includes an exit condition in the loop to prevent infinite looping.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

However, the agent did not reach a delivery cell and did not drop off the parcel. To improve plan generation, the agent should include actions to move towards the nearest delivery cell after picking up the parcel. Additionally, the agent should also have actions to handle obstacles like doors, especially since it has picked up a key and can use it to open doors if necessary."}

Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent's goal was to find the nearest parcel, pick it up and then find the nearest delivery cell to drop it off. From the belief sets and actions performed, it is clear that the agent was able to find and pick up the parcel, as indicated by the 'object changed' event for the agent and the parcel. However, the agent did not reach a delivery cell and did not drop off the parcel. To improve plan generation, the agent should include actions to move towards the nearest delivery cell after picking up the parcel. Additionally, the agent should also have actions to handle obstacles like doors, especially since it has picked up a key and can use it to open doors if necessary.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to find and pick up the nearest parcel, then navigate towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel. The agent should also be able to open doors using a key, if one is available in its possession.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': True, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': 1}}
- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 40}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'key', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object removed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collect all available parcels and keys, and make successful deliveries to the designated cells, all while maximizing the overall score.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


This is the belief set of the agent after having pursued the goal:

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collect all available parcels and keys, and make successful deliveries to the designated cells, all while maximizing the overall score.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'has_key': False, 'score': 40}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'double_points_delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}]}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}, 'agents': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1], 'has_key': False, 'score': 0}}, 'keys': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'carried_by_id': None}}, 'doors': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2]}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [1, 3]}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [3, 1]}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

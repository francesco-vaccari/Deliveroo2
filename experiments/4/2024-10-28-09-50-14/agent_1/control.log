However, from the belief set, it can be seen that the agent has only moved towards the parcel but hasn't picked it up. The agent's action is only related to movement, and no action was performed to pick up the parcel. Hence, the plan generation needs to include actions not only to move the agent to the parcel's coordinates but also to pick up the parcel. This could be achieved by including a 'pick' action in the plan after the agent has moved to the parcel's coordinates.

2024-10-28 09:53:05,353 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error received was a timeout error, which suggests that the problem was related to an infinite loop of actions to execute. Looking at the function implemented, the while loops do not have a proper exit condition, they only rely on the 'has_key' attribute of the agent. If the agent is unable to acquire a key (e.g., if the key is inaccessible), the function will keep running indefinitely, leading to a timeout. One suggestion to avoid this in the future is to implement a maximum number of iterations for the while loop, after which the function should exit even if the agent has not acquired a key. Another suggestion is to include checks and error handling to ensure the agent can reach the key before entering the loop. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest key, pick it up if not carrying one already, and then move towards the nearest door to unlock it.

However, the agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest key and pick it up, then move towards the nearest door to unlock it. If the agent is unable to acquire a key after a number of attempts, it should move towards the nearest parcel. The function's logic might not be serving this purpose effectively. To avoid this in the future, ensure that the logic of the function aligns with the intended goal. Add checks to prevent infinite loops by ensuring progress in the agent's actions. Use proper conditional statements to guide the agent's actions based on the environment and its current state. For example, if the agent already has a parcel, there's no need to keep calling function_5(). Moreover, it's not clear what function_9() does, as it seems to perform the same actions as the whole function. Consider revising its usage.

The condition 'agent['coordinates'] != nearest_key_location' never becomes false, possibly because the agent is unable to reach the key's location. This could be due to obstacles or inaccessible paths. The function should account for such situations and break the loop if the agent cannot reach the target location. 2.

If the executed actions do not update the agent's coordinates in the belief set, the condition will never be satisfied. To resolve this, ensure that the agent's coordinates are updated in real time in the belief set after executing each action. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate to the nearest key and pick it up if the agent was not already carrying a key.

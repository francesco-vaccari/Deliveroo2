[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up the parcel and then move towards the nearest delivery cell to deliver the parcel.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:

- function_7()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up the parcel and then move towards the nearest delivery cell to deliver the parcel.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The agent was trying to reach the parcel spawn location and then the delivery cell to deliver a parcel. The error received was a timeout error, which indicates an infinite loop during the execution of the function. This might have happened because the agent was trying to move towards a parcel that was unreachable due to being blocked by non-walkable cells, or due to an error in the condition for the while loop in the function. To avoid such errors in the future, you should ensure that the exit condition in your loop is correct and that it will eventually be met. Additionally, include checks in your function to ensure that the target location is reachable from the agent's current position before attempting to move towards it. Finally, avoid writing functions that may lead to an infinite loop of actions to execute, and consider adding a maximum number of iterations to your loops as a failsafe measure."}

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to explore the map, identify all parcel spawn locations and delivery cells, and plan optimal routes between them for efficient parcel delivery.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent was trying to reach the parcel spawn location and then the delivery cell to deliver a parcel. The error received was a timeout error, which indicates an infinite loop during the execution of the function. This might have happened because the agent was trying to move towards a parcel that was unreachable due to being blocked by non-walkable cells, or due to an error in the condition for the while loop in the function. To avoid such errors in the future, you should ensure that the exit condition in your loop is correct and that it will eventually be met. Additionally, include checks in your function to ensure that the target location is reachable from the agent's current position before attempting to move towards it. Finally, avoid writing functions that may lead to an infinite loop of actions to execute, and consider adding a maximum number of iterations to your loops as a failsafe measure.

The function should achieve the following short term goal description:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest reachable parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel.

However, while testing the validity of the function the following error occured:
Error: The code contains more than one function definition..


You have to modify and fix the function in order to achieve the short term goal description. The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

The function should achieve the following short term goal description:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest reachable parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel.

However, while testing the validity of the function the following error occured:
Error: The code contains more than one function definition..


You have to modify and fix the function in order to achieve the short term goal description. The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to explore the map, identify all parcel spawn locations and delivery cells, and plan optimal routes between them for efficient parcel delivery.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent was trying to reach the parcel spawn location and then the delivery cell to deliver a parcel. The error received was a timeout error, which indicates an infinite loop during the execution of the function. This might have happened because the agent was trying to move towards a parcel that was unreachable due to being blocked by non-walkable cells, or due to an error in the condition for the while loop in the function. To avoid such errors in the future, you should ensure that the exit condition in your loop is correct and that it will eventually be met. Additionally, include checks in your function to ensure that the target location is reachable from the agent's current position before attempting to move towards it. Finally, avoid writing functions that may lead to an infinite loop of actions to execute, and consider adding a maximum number of iterations to your loops as a failsafe measure.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to explore the map, identify all parcel spawn locations and delivery cells, and plan optimal routes between them for efficient parcel delivery.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent's long term goal is to explore the map, identify all parcel spawn locations and delivery cells, and plan optimal routes between them for efficient parcel delivery.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 120}}, 'parcels': {7: {'id': 7, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    agent = belief_set['agent'][1]
    parcels_spawn = [cell for cell in belief_set['map']['grid'] if cell['cell_type'] == 'parcels_spawn'][0]
    delivery_cell = [cell for cell in belief_set['map']['grid'] if cell['cell_type'] == 'delivery_cell'][0]
    while agent['coordinates'] != parcels_spawn['cell_coordinates']:

            function_4()
    function_6()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_9()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 140}}, 'parcels': {8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 140}}

	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	None
	Summary of actions executed:
	- Action: action_1, Executed 26 times


After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error was a timeout error, indicating that the function probably got stuck in an infinite loop of actions. This was likely because the agent kept attempting to pick up a parcel even after it had already done so. To avoid this in the future, you could add a condition to check if the agent is already carrying a parcel before attempting to pick up another one. Additionally, it seems that the agent is not moving towards the delivery cell after picking up the parcels, which would be necessary to achieve its short term goal of delivering parcels. This could be addressed by adding a condition to check whether the agent is carrying a parcel, and if so, move towards the delivery cell. Furthermore, the agent should also have a mechanism to stop executing actions when its goal has been achieved, to avoid unnecessary moves. The short term goal was for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The error received was a timeout error, which suggests that the function got stuck in an infinite loop. This could be due to the fact that the agent's state or the environment's state isn't updated in the loop, so the agent keeps executing the same actions without making progress towards its goal. To avoid this, make sure to update the agent's state and the environment's state inside the loop after each action. Also, consider adding a maximum number of iterations condition to the loop, which breaks the loop after a certain number of iterations to prevent infinite loops. Finally, make sure that the conditions for the while loop and the if statements are correctly defined, so that the agent can actually achieve its goal and exit the loop. The agent was trying to achieve the short term goal of moving towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel if it isn't carrying any, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to optimize its route in order to collect as many parcels as possible and deliver them to the delivery cell in the least amount of time.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent's long term goal is to optimize its route in order to collect as many parcels as possible and deliver them to the delivery cell in the least amount of time.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 300}}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [8, 9, 10, 11], 'score': 140}}, 'parcels': {8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 10: {'id': 10, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 12: {'id': 12, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 13: {'id': 13, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 14: {'id': 14, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.
- function_12()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    while True:
        if belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'] == belief_set['parcels'][16]['coordinates']:
            function_5()
        elif belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'] == [belief_set['map']['grid'][7]['cell_coordinates'][0], belief_set['map']['grid'][7]['cell_coordinates'][1]]:
            function_6()
        elif belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][0] > belief_set['parcels'][16]['coordinates'][0] and belief_set['map']['grid'][(belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][0] - 1) * belief_set['map']['width'] + belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][1]]['cell_type'] == 'walkable':
            function_1()
        elif belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][0] < belief_set['parcels'][16]['coordinates'][0] and belief_set['map']['grid'][(belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][0] + 1) * belief_set['map']['width'] + belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][1]]['cell_type'] == 'walkable':
            function_2()
        elif belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][1] > belief_set['parcels'][16]['coordinates'][1] and belief_set['map']['grid'][belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][0] * belief_set['map']['width'] + (belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][1] - 1)]['cell_type'] == 'walkable':
            function_3()
        elif belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][1] < belief_set['parcels'][16]['coordinates'][1] and belief_set['map']['grid'][belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][0] * belief_set['map']['width'] + (belief_set['agent'][1]['coordinates'][1] + 1)]['cell_type'] == 'walkable':
            function_4()
        else:
            break

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel, while avoiding non-walkable cells.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.
- function_12()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.
- function_13()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel, while avoiding non-walkable cells.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 300}}, 'parcels': {16: {'id': 16, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_6 , Events received:

	Last 2 actions executed:
	- Action: action_6 , Events received:

	- Action: action_6 , Events received:

	Summary of actions executed:
	- Action: action_6, Executed 27 times


After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 300}}, 'parcels': {16: {'id': 16, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 17: {'id': 17, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

Response: {"suggestions": "The agent received a timeout error which suggests that the function was stuck in an infinite loop. The agent was trying to achieve the short term goal of moving towards the nearest parcel, picking it up, and then moving towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel, while avoiding non-walkable cells. One possible reason for the loop is that the agent was stuck trying to execute action_6, which is putting down objects in the current cell. However, the agent didn't carry any parcels, causing the agent to repeatedly execute action_6 without making any progress. To avoid this, make sure the agent checks if it carries any parcels before executing action_6. Another potential issue is the lack of a break condition in the loop if the agent cannot move towards the parcel due to non-walkable cells. Adding conditions to handle non-walkable cells could prevent this. Lastly, consider adding a maximum iteration counter in the loop to force an exit after a certain number of iterations, which can prevent endless loops."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to continually improve its strategy for avoiding non_walkable cells and efficiently navigate towards the parcels_spawn and delivery_cell areas.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 300}}, 'parcels': {16: {'id': 16, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 17: {'id': 17, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 18: {'id': 18, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.
- function_12()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent received a timeout error which suggests that the function was stuck in an infinite loop. The agent was trying to achieve the short term goal of moving towards the nearest parcel, picking it up, and then moving towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel, while avoiding non-walkable cells. One possible reason for the loop is that the agent was stuck trying to execute action_6, which is putting down objects in the current cell. However, the agent didn't carry any parcels, causing the agent to repeatedly execute action_6 without making any progress. To avoid this, make sure the agent checks if it carries any parcels before executing action_6.

Adding conditions to handle non-walkable cells could prevent this. Lastly, consider adding a maximum iteration counter in the loop to force an exit after a certain number of iterations, which can prevent endless loops.

Response: {"suggestions": "The error that occurred was a timeout error, which means the function took too long to execute. This could be due to many reasons such as an infinite loop in the function or the function being too computationally expensive. One suggestion to avoid this in the future is to optimize the function so that it executes more efficiently. This could be achieved by reducing the number of iterations in the loop, optimizing the functions called within the loop or implementing a more efficient algorithm. Another suggestion is to include a condition to break the loop if the function takes too long to execute, to avoid a timeout error. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel if it's available, then move towards the nearest delivery cell and drop off the parcel if it's carrying one, while avoiding non-walkable cells."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to continually improve its strategy for avoiding non_walkable cells and efficiently navigate towards the parcels_spawn and delivery_cell areas.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [19], 'score': 360}}, 'parcels': {19: {'id': 19, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.
- function_12()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error that occurred was a timeout error, which means the function took too long to execute. This could be due to many reasons such as an infinite loop in the function or the function being too computationally expensive. One suggestion to avoid this in the future is to optimize the function so that it executes more efficiently. This could be achieved by reducing the number of iterations in the loop, optimizing the functions called within the loop or implementing a more efficient algorithm. Another suggestion is to include a condition to break the loop if the function takes too long to execute, to avoid a timeout error. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel if it's available, then move towards the nearest delivery cell and drop off the parcel if it's carrying one, while avoiding non-walkable cells.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel if it's not carrying any, pick it up, then move towards the nearest delivery cell and drop off the parcel if it's carrying one, while avoiding non-walkable cells.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [19], 'score': 360}}, 'parcels': {19: {'id': 19, 'coordinates': [1, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_4 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 19, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}
- Action: action_6 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 19, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 360}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 360}}, 'parcels': {19: {'id': 19, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved the short term goal of picking up a parcel and dropping it off at a delivery cell. The agent started with a parcel and ended up dropping it off at a non-delivery cell. The plan generation process needs to ensure that the agent is dropping off parcels only at delivery cells. It could be improved by including a validation step that checks whether the agent's intended drop-off location is a delivery cell. Additionally, the plan could include a step for the agent to verify its current location before performing the drop-off action, to avoid dropping off the parcel at an incorrect location."}

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to optimize its route in order to collect as many parcels as possible and deliver them to the delivery cell in the least amount of time.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

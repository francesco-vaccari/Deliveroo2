2024-11-01 09:49:14,465 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The agent was trying to reach the parcel spawn location and then the delivery cell to deliver a parcel. The error received was a timeout error, which indicates an infinite loop during the execution of the function. This might have happened because the agent was trying to move towards a parcel that was unreachable due to being blocked by non-walkable cells, or due to an error in the condition for the while loop in the function. To avoid such errors in the future, you should ensure that the exit condition in your loop is correct and that it will eventually be met. Additionally, include checks in your function to ensure that the target location is reachable from the agent's current position before attempting to move towards it. Finally, avoid writing functions that may lead to an infinite loop of actions to execute, and consider adding a maximum number of iterations to your loops as a failsafe measure.

2024-11-01 09:52:06,220 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error was a timeout error, indicating that the function probably got stuck in an infinite loop of actions. This was likely because the agent kept attempting to pick up a parcel even after it had already done so. To avoid this in the future, you could add a condition to check if the agent is already carrying a parcel before attempting to pick up another one. Additionally, it seems that the agent is not moving towards the delivery cell after picking up the parcels, which would be necessary to achieve its short term goal of delivering parcels. This could be addressed by adding a condition to check whether the agent is carrying a parcel, and if so, move towards the delivery cell. Furthermore, the agent should also have a mechanism to stop executing actions when its goal has been achieved, to avoid unnecessary moves. The short term goal was for the agent to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then move towards the closest delivery cell and drop off the parcel.

2024-11-01 09:54:15,683 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The agent received a timeout error which suggests that the function was stuck in an infinite loop. The agent was trying to achieve the short term goal of moving towards the nearest parcel, picking it up, and then moving towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel, while avoiding non-walkable cells. One possible reason for the loop is that the agent was stuck trying to execute action_6, which is putting down objects in the current cell. However, the agent didn't carry any parcels, causing the agent to repeatedly execute action_6 without making any progress. To avoid this, make sure the agent checks if it carries any parcels before executing action_6. Another potential issue is the lack of a break condition in the loop if the agent cannot move towards the parcel due to non-walkable cells. Adding conditions to handle non-walkable cells could prevent this. Lastly, consider adding a maximum iteration counter in the loop to force an exit after a certain number of iterations, which can prevent endless loops.
2024-11-01 09:54:15,714 - INFO - [LOOP] Memory updated: The agent received a timeout error which suggests that the function was stuck in an infinite loop. The agent was trying to achieve the short term goal of moving towards the nearest parcel, picking it up, and then moving towards the nearest delivery cell to drop off the parcel, while avoiding non-walkable cells. One possible reason for the loop is that the agent was stuck trying to execute action_6, which is putting down objects in the current cell. However, the agent didn't carry any parcels, causing the agent to repeatedly execute action_6 without making any progress. To avoid this, make sure the agent checks if it carries any parcels before executing action_6.

2024-11-01 09:54:44,119 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error that occurred was a timeout error, which means the function took too long to execute. This could be due to many reasons such as an infinite loop in the function or the function being too computationally expensive. One suggestion to avoid this in the future is to optimize the function so that it executes more efficiently. This could be achieved by reducing the number of iterations in the loop, optimizing the functions called within the loop or implementing a more efficient algorithm. Another suggestion is to include a condition to break the loop if the function takes too long to execute, to avoid a timeout error. The agent's short term goal was to move towards the nearest parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel if it's available, then move towards the nearest delivery cell and drop off the parcel if it's carrying one, while avoiding non-walkable cells.

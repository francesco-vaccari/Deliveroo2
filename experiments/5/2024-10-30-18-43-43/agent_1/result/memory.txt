- The error that occured was a timeout error which suggests that the function may have entered into an infinite loop. This could be due to the fact that the agent's coordinates were not being updated after each move. To avoid this in the future, ensure that the agent's coordinates are updated after each move action. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate towards the parcel spawn location, pick up the parcel, and then move to the delivery cell to drop the parcel.
- The agent did not achieve its short-term goal. The goal was to pick up the parcel at the spawn location and drop it at the delivery cell. However, based on the events and the final belief set, it seems that the agent picked up the parcels but dropped them at a walkable cell ([1, 1]) instead of the delivery cell. The agent needs to improve its pathfinding to ensure it reaches the delivery cell before dropping the parcels. Also, the agent needs to distinguish between walkable cells and delivery cells in the belief set and act accordingly.
- The error encountered indicates that the function executed by the agent exceeded the time limit set for its execution. This often suggests that there is an infinite loop in the function. Looking at the implementation of the function, it seems that the agent's location is not updated within the while loops, which are supposed to break when the agent reaches a certain location. As a result, the condition for the while loop is always met, creating an infinite loop. Hence, to avoid this error in the future, make sure to update the condition variables within the loop. Also, consider adding checks to prevent infinite loops by setting a maximum number of iterations. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate through the map, pick up the parcels at the spawn location, and then move to the delivery cell to drop the parcels.

- The agent was supposed to move to a nearby parcel, pick it up, and move towards the delivery cell. However, it appears that the agent only moved to a nearby parcel but did not pick it up nor move towards the delivery cell. The agent's coordinates after executing the plan are [1, 0], which indicates that they only moved one cell away from their starting position [0, 0]. They did not pick up any parcels as indicated by their 'parcels_carried_ids' being empty. To improve the plan, the agent should ensure that their actions include picking up a parcel after moving to its location. The agent should also plan to move towards the delivery cell after picking up the parcel.

- The function executed by the agent resulted in a timeout error, indicating that it likely got stuck in an infinite loop of actions. The primary issue seems to be with the while loop condition where the agent's coordinates are checked against the delivery cell coordinates. If the agent is unable to reach the destination due to obstacles or other factors, the loop will continue indefinitely. In the future, consider implementing a break or timeout condition within the while loop to prevent infinite iterations. Also, ensure that the agent has a viable path to its destination before initiating the movement sequence. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the delivery cell and deliver the parcels it was carrying.

- The agent's goal was to move to the nearest parcel, pick it up, and deliver it to a delivery cell. However, the agent has only moved to a new coordinate [0, 3] but didn't pick up any parcel. To improve the plan generation, the agent should first identify the nearest parcel, then generate a plan to navigate to that parcel, taking into account any obstacles in the path. Once the parcel is picked up, the agent should make a plan to navigate to the nearest delivery cell. Also, it is important to ensure that the agent checks the preconditions before performing an action to avoid failures.
- 
- The short term goal of the agent was to pick up the nearest parcel and deliver it to the delivery cell. The agent did manage to pick up two parcels and move towards the delivery cell, but only one parcel was delivered. This means the agent has only partially achieved its goal. To improve plan generation, the agent should ensure that all parcels picked up are successfully delivered. The agent could achieve this by executing an additional delivery action for each parcel that it is carrying before considering the plan complete.
- 
- The agent did not manage to pick up any parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, hence the goal was not achieved. The agent did not perform any actions as the plan was empty. To improve plan generation, the agent could start by planning a route to the parcel spawn cell [0, 0] to pick up parcels. After picking up parcels, the agent should then plan a route to the delivery cell [1, 3] to deliver them. The agent should also ensure that it is able to navigate around non-walkable cells.

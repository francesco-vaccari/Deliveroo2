[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, keep this in mind when structuring the belief set. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'parcel' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'parcel'.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}

Example 2:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'parcel'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move the agent towards the battery spawn if its energy level is below 50, otherwise move it towards the parcel spawn.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 98}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent did not achieve its short term goal. The goal was to move towards the battery spawn if its energy level is below 50, or towards the parcel spawn if its energy level is above 50. However, the agent's energy level was 100, and it moved away from the parcel spawn, which was at coordinates [0, 0]. The agent should have moved towards the parcel spawn given its energy levels. The plan generation needs to correctly take into account the agent's energy level in deciding the direction of movement."}

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to collect all available parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while efficiently managing its energy by collecting batteries when necessary.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the cell containing the parcels and pick them up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The function is likely stuck in an infinite loop, which is causing it to timeout. This is due to the agent's movement logic in the while loop. Once the agent's first coordinate equals the delivery cell's first coordinate, the agent doesn't have a way to move in the second coordinate direction. To fix this, you should add an else clause after the first two if-elif statements that handles the case when agent['coordinates'][0] == delivery_cell['cell_coordinates'][0]. This else clause should contain the logic to move in the second coordinate direction. The agent's short term goal was to move to the cell containing the delivery point and deliver the parcels."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the cell containing the parcels and pick them up.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The function is likely stuck in an infinite loop, which is causing it to timeout. This is due to the agent's movement logic in the while loop. Once the agent's first coordinate equals the delivery cell's first coordinate, the agent doesn't have a way to move in the second coordinate direction. To fix this, you should add an else clause after the first two if-elif statements that handles the case when agent['coordinates'][0] == delivery_cell['cell_coordinates'][0]. This else clause should contain the logic to move in the second coordinate direction. The agent's short term goal was to move to the cell containing the delivery point and deliver the parcels.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The following python function:

def function():

    function_6()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing the delivery point and deliver all the parcels it is carrying.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.

- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.

- function_10()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move to the cell containing the delivery point and deliver all the parcels it is carrying.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.

Response: {"suggestions": "The error that occurred was a timeout error. This suggests that the function entered an infinite loop of actions to execute. In this case, the agent continually executed action_4, attempting to move to a cell with higher y-coordinate, even though it had already reached its destination. To avoid this error, the function should have a condition to break the loop once the agent has reached the delivery cell. This can be achieved by updating the agent's coordinates on each iteration and checking if it has reached the delivery cell. The function should also account for the possibility that the agent might not be able to reach the delivery cell due to obstacles or lack of energy.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'score': 0, 'energy': 82}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 7: {'id': 7, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to collect all available parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while efficiently managing its energy by collecting batteries when necessary.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the cell containing the parcels and pick them up.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...



Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'.

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to collect all available parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while efficiently managing its energy by collecting batteries when necessary.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent should aim to collect all available parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while efficiently managing its energy by collecting batteries when necessary.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 200, 'energy': 56}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the cell containing the parcels and pick them up.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.
- function_12()	Description: The agent should move towards the parcels spawn cell, pick up all available parcels and then proceed to the delivery cell if the energy level allows it. If the energy is less than 50%, the agent should go to the batteries spawn cell first, pick up a battery and then proceed to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...



Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should aim to move towards the batteries spawn cell, pick up a battery if the energy level is less than 50%, then proceed to visit all walkable cells on the grid.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 200, 'energy': 56}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 200, 'energy': 56}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent didn't achieve its short-term goal of moving towards the batteries spawn cell and visiting all walkable cells. The agent's energy level was above 50%, so picking up a battery wasn't necessary. However, the agent didn't move from its initial coordinates [2, 3], which suggests that the action performed didn't result in any movement or it failed. To improve plan generation, ensure that the actions selected result in the agent moving to the desired locations. Actions should be chosen based on the current state of the environment and the agent's current position. Also, the agent needs to visit all walkable cells, so make sure the plan includes actions to visit all such cells."}

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to explore all walkable cells on the map, while preserving its energy by collecting batteries as needed.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 200, 'energy': 56}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the cell containing the parcels and pick them up.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.
- function_12()	Description: The agent should move towards the parcels spawn cell, pick up all available parcels and then proceed to the delivery cell if the energy level allows it. If the energy is less than 50%, the agent should go to the batteries spawn cell first, pick up a battery and then proceed to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...



Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should aim to move towards the battery spawn cell to pick up a battery if the energy level is less than 50%. If the energy level is above 50%, the agent should move towards the parcels spawn cell, pick up all available parcels, and then proceed to the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to explore all walkable cells on the map, while preserving its energy by collecting batteries as needed.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the cell containing the parcels and pick them up.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.
- function_12()	Description: The agent should move towards the parcels spawn cell, pick up all available parcels and then proceed to the delivery cell if the energy level allows it. If the energy is less than 50%, the agent should go to the batteries spawn cell first, pick up a battery and then proceed to the delivery cell.
- function_14()	Description: The agent should aim to move towards the battery spawn cell to pick up a battery if the energy level is less than 50%. If the energy level is above 50%, the agent should move towards the parcels spawn cell, pick up all available parcels, and then proceed to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should aim to move to the nearest unexplored walkable cell. If the agent's energy level drops below 50%, it should first go to the nearest batteries spawn cell to recharge.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 240, 'energy': 92}}, 'batteries': {}, 'parcels': {}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 240, 'energy': 90}}

	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 240, 'energy': 86}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent did not achieve its short term goal of moving to the nearest unexplored walkable cell or recharging its battery when energy level drops below 50%. The agent's energy level is still above 50%, hence it did not need to recharge. However, the agent did not move to any unexplored cell. This could be due to the agent's inability to identify unexplored cells. To improve plan generation, the agent needs to incorporate a mechanism to identify unexplored cells. Furthermore, the agent should also have a mechanism to identify when its energy level drops below 50% in order to recharge."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to move the agent to the cell containing the parcels and pick them up.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.
- function_12()	Description: The agent should move towards the parcels spawn cell, pick up all available parcels and then proceed to the delivery cell if the energy level allows it. If the energy is less than 50%, the agent should go to the batteries spawn cell first, pick up a battery and then proceed to the delivery cell.
- function_14()	Description: The agent should aim to move towards the battery spawn cell to pick up a battery if the energy level is less than 50%. If the energy level is above 50%, the agent should move towards the parcels spawn cell, pick up all available parcels, and then proceed to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to check the agent's energy level. If it's less than 50%, the agent should move to the battery spawn cell and pick up a battery. If the energy level is above 50%, the agent should explore the nearest unvisited walkable cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 260, 'energy': 64}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {14: {'id': 14, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to collect all available parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while efficiently managing its energy by collecting batteries when necessary.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards and pickup a parcel if its energy is above 50% and it is not currently carrying any parcels. If the agent's energy is below 50%, it will move towards and pickup a battery. If the agent is carrying a parcel, it will move towards the delivery cell to deliver the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 260, 'energy': 62}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {14: {'id': 14, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 15: {'id': 15, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 16: {'id': 16, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 260, 'energy': 60}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 260, 'energy': 60}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {14: {'id': 14, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 15: {'id': 15, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 16: {'id': 16, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent did not achieve the short term goal. The agent's objective was to move towards and pickup a parcel because its energy was above 50% and it was not carrying any parcels. However, the agent only moved from [1,3] to [0,3] and did not pick up any parcel. In order to improve the plan, it should include actions that allow the agent to move towards the parcel located at [0,0] and execute a pickup action. Additionally, the plan should consider the energy cost of moving and ensure that the agent's energy remains above 50% before attempting to pickup a parcel."}

The agent should then move towards the delivery_cell to drop off any parcels it is carrying.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_3 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 260, 'energy': 58}}
	- Action: action_5 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_3 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 260, 'energy': 56}}

	- Action: action_3, Executed 14 times


After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.

Response: {"suggestions": "The error that occurred was a timeout error, which suggests that the function is trapped in an infinite loop. The function is making while loops to wait until the agent reaches certain locations, however, the agent's location is not updated within these loops, which can cause an infinite loop if the agent doesn't reach the target location. To avoid this, the position of the agent should be updated inside the while loops, or the while loops should be replaced with conditionals that determine the next action based on the current state. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the parcels_spawn location, pick up any parcels on the way, then move to the batteries_spawn location, pick up batteries if its energy is less than 50%, and then move towards the delivery_cell to drop off any parcels it is carrying."}

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should aim to optimize its route in order to collect as many parcels and batteries as possible, while minimizing energy expenditure and avoiding non-walkable areas.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The error that occurred was a timeout error, which suggests that the function is trapped in an infinite loop. The function is making while loops to wait until the agent reaches certain locations, however, the agent's location is not updated within these loops, which can cause an infinite loop if the agent doesn't reach the target location. To avoid this, the position of the agent should be updated inside the while loops, or the while loops should be replaced with conditionals that determine the next action based on the current state. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the parcels_spawn location, pick up any parcels on the way, then move to the batteries_spawn location, pick up batteries if its energy is less than 50%, and then move towards the delivery_cell to drop off any parcels it is carrying.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the 'parcels_spawn' location, pick up any parcels, move to the 'batteries_spawn' location, pick up batteries if its energy is less than 50%, then move towards the 'delivery_cell' while avoiding non-walkable areas to drop off any parcels it is carrying.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 'score': 260, 'energy': 50}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {14: {'id': 14, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 15: {'id': 15, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 16: {'id': 16, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 17: {'id': 17, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 18: {'id': 18, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 19: {'id': 19, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 21: {'id': 21, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'.

The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to optimize its route in order to collect as many parcels and batteries as possible, while minimizing energy expenditure and avoiding non-walkable areas.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent should aim to optimize its route in order to collect as many parcels and batteries as possible, while minimizing energy expenditure and avoiding non-walkable areas.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 420, 'energy': 92}}, 'batteries': {}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 260, 'energy': 62}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {14: {'id': 14, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 15: {'id': 15, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.
- function_20()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the 'parcels_spawn' location, pick up any parcels, move to the 'batteries_spawn' location, pick up batteries if its energy is less than 50%, then move towards the 'delivery_cell' while avoiding non-walkable areas to drop off any parcels it is carrying.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should aim to move towards the parcels spawn location, pick up any parcels, and then move to the delivery cell to drop off the parcels it is carrying. During this process, it should also check its energy levels. If the energy level is less than 50% and the agent is on the batteries spawn cell, it should pick up a battery.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should strive to maintain a high energy level for maximum operational uptime and efficiency while ensuring the timely delivery of parcels to their respective locations.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.
- function_20()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the 'parcels_spawn' location, pick up any parcels, move to the 'batteries_spawn' location, pick up batteries if its energy is less than 50%, then move towards the 'delivery_cell' while avoiding non-walkable areas to drop off any parcels it is carrying.
- function_21()	Description: The agent should aim to move towards the parcels spawn location, pick up any parcels, and then move to the delivery cell to drop off the parcels it is carrying. During this process, it should also check its energy levels. If the energy level is less than 50% and the agent is on the batteries spawn cell, it should pick up a battery.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should aim to efficiently pick up parcels and batteries when necessary, and deliver parcels to the delivery cell, while maintaining a high energy level.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 460, 'energy': 44}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not fully achieved the short term goal. The agent was successful in picking up a parcel and delivering it, which increased the score. However, the agent's energy level dropped significantly during the process, from 68 to 44. This suggests that the agent used a non-optimal path to the parcel and to the delivery cell. The agent could improve plan generation by calculating the shortest path to the parcel and delivery cell. This would reduce the energy consumption. Moreover, the agent should consider picking up batteries when the energy level is low. In this case, the agent could have picked up the battery at location [2,0] after delivering the parcel."}

[CONTROL Q2]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent should strive to maintain a high energy level for maximum operational uptime and efficiency while ensuring the timely delivery of parcels to their respective locations.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_11()	Description: The agent should aim to move to the delivery cell and drop off all the parcels it is carrying, while also checking that it has enough energy to perform the action. If the agent finds itself on the batteries spawn cell while having less than 50% energy, it should pick up a battery before moving to the delivery cell.
- function_20()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the 'parcels_spawn' location, pick up any parcels, move to the 'batteries_spawn' location, pick up batteries if its energy is less than 50%, then move towards the 'delivery_cell' while avoiding non-walkable areas to drop off any parcels it is carrying.
- function_21()	Description: The agent should aim to move towards the parcels spawn location, pick up any parcels, and then move to the delivery cell to drop off the parcels it is carrying. During this process, it should also check its energy levels. If the energy level is less than 50% and the agent is on the batteries spawn cell, it should pick up a battery.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short-term goal is to move towards the parcel spawn location, pick up any parcels, then move to the battery spawn location, pick up a battery if its energy is less than 50%, and finally move towards the delivery cell to drop off the parcels it is carrying.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent should strive to maintain a high energy level for maximum operational uptime and efficiency while ensuring the timely delivery of parcels to their respective locations.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 480, 'energy': 92}}, 'batteries': {}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 420, 'energy': 92}}, 'batteries': {}, 'parcels': {}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

[CONTROL Q5]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to optimize its route in order to collect as many parcels and batteries as possible, while minimizing energy expenditure and avoiding non-walkable areas.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

In the function, it seems that the agent's location ('agent_location') is not being updated after each movement, leading to the agent repeatedly moving in the same direction without ever reaching its destination. To avoid this error in the future, ensure to update the 'agent_location' after each movement. This can be done by receiving the updated location from the environment after each action. Also, adding error checking or limit checks to prevent infinite loops can be beneficial. Always keep a check for any preconditions that have to be met for the loop to break, and if they are not met within a certain number of iterations, the function should stop execution and return an error. The short-term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate to the closest parcel, pick it up, and then move towards the delivery cell.

In the function, it seems that the agent's location ('agent_location') is not being updated after each movement, leading to the agent repeatedly moving in the same direction without ever reaching its destination.

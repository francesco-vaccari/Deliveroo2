Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate the agent to the nearest parcel, pick it up and deliver it to the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent should aim to efficiently collect and deliver as many parcels as possible within the map while maintaining sufficient energy levels by picking up batteries when necessary.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent should aim to efficiently collect and deliver as many parcels as possible within the map while maintaining sufficient energy levels by picking up batteries when necessary.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 80}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.



Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

[CONTROL Q7]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    agent = belief_set['agent'][1]
    parcel_spawn_cell = [cell for cell in belief_set['map']['grid'] if cell['cell_type'] == 'parcels_spawn'][0]
    parcel_spawn_coordinates = parcel_spawn_cell['cell_coordinates']
    while agent['coordinates'] != parcel_spawn_coordinates:
        if agent['coordinates'][0] > parcel_spawn_coordinates[0]:
            function_1()
        elif agent['coordinates'][0] < parcel_spawn_coordinates[0]:

        elif agent['coordinates'][1] < parcel_spawn_coordinates[1]:
            function_4()
    function_5()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the parcel spawn cell to pick up a parcel. By doing so, the agent progresses towards its long-term goal of delivering parcels.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_8()	Description: The short term goal is to navigate the agent towards the parcel spawn cell to pick up a parcel. By doing so, the agent progresses towards its long-term goal of delivering parcels.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 80}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 78}}
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 76}}

After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 76}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.

Response: {"suggestions": "The error indicates a timeout, which suggests that there might be an infinite loop in the function. One potential cause of this is that the agent is stuck in a situation where it cannot reach the target cell due to obstacles or the layout of the environment but the function continues to attempt to reach the target. To avoid this in the future, consider implementing condition checks to ensure that the target cell is reachable from the agent's current location. If not, the function should be able to handle this and alter its course of action. Furthermore, the function should have a way to break from the loop if it continues for too long, which would help prevent timeout errors. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to navigate towards the parcel spawn cell to pick up a parcel."}

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn cell while ensuring that the path to the target is clear. If the path is not clear, the agent should alter its course and if the agent is stuck in a loop, it should break out of it after a certain number of attempts.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 76}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 74}}

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collecting parcels from the spawn area and delivering them to the designated delivery cell while managing its energy level by collecting batteries from the batteries spawn area.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collecting parcels from the spawn area and delivering them to the designated delivery cell while managing its energy level by collecting batteries from the batteries spawn area.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 70}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn cell while ensuring that the path to the target is clear. If the path is not clear, the agent should alter its course and if the agent is stuck in a loop, it should break out of it after a certain number of attempts.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collecting parcels from the spawn area and delivering them to the designated delivery cell while managing its energy level by collecting batteries from the batteries spawn area.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 68}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 7: {'id': 7, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn cell while ensuring that the path to the target is clear. If the path is not clear, the agent should alter its course and if the agent is stuck in a loop, it should break out of it after a certain number of attempts.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to pick up a parcel from the spawn cell, if it's currently in that cell. If not, it should navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 68}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 7: {'id': 7, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 66}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collecting parcels from the spawn area and delivering them to the designated delivery cell while managing its energy level by collecting batteries from the batteries spawn area.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

Question: Given the following goal description:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the map, collecting parcels from the spawn area and delivering them to the designated delivery cell while managing its energy level by collecting batteries from the batteries spawn area.

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 160, 'energy': 52}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 40, 'energy': 80}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The function should be able to handle as input both the current belief set and the previous belief set.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn cell while ensuring that the path to the target is clear. If the path is not clear, the agent should alter its course and if the agent is stuck in a loop, it should break out of it after a certain number of attempts.
- function_12()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to navigate to the parcel spawn location, pick up any parcels, and then move to the delivery cell to drop off the parcels.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 160, 'energy': 52}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_9()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to navigate towards the nearest parcel spawn cell while ensuring that the path to the target is clear. If the path is not clear, the agent should alter its course and if the agent is stuck in a loop, it should break out of it after a certain number of attempts.
- function_12()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to navigate to the parcel spawn location, pick up any parcels, and then move to the delivery cell to drop off the parcels.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to navigate to the nearest parcel, pick it up, and then move to the delivery cell to drop off the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 160, 'energy': 52}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Provide a function that evaluates whether the goal should be pursued or not, given the current belief set. The function takes as input the argument 'belief_set', and returns either 'True' or 'False'. The belief set is structured like the following example:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 180, 'energy': 28}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {}}

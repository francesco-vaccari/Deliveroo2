[PERCEPTION Q1]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Write a function that takes as input an event and the current belief set, and returns the updated belief set that incorporates the information from the event.

The input event is structured like the following examples:

Example 1:
{'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'map', 'object': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}}




The input event describes a change in the state of an object in the environment. The field 'object_type' specifies the type of the object. The function you provide will only be used to process events for the object 'map'. Other functions will be used to process events for other object types. Each function updates the belief set indipedently from the others.

The input event has the field 'event_type' that specifies the type of event. The field 'event_type' can be one of the following:
- 'object added' meaning that the object didn't exist before and now it does;
- 'object changed' meaning that the object already existed before and now at least one of its properties or attributes has changed;
- 'object removed' meaning that the object existed before and now it doesn't.


The belief set is a python dictionary. Update it with the information from the event. The current belief set is structured like this:

{}


The belief set should be structured in a way that makes it easy to use later. Multiple objects in the environment might belong to the same object type, using the object type is recommended to divide the belief set into different sections. If you think that the way the information about the object type 'map' is not structured in the best way, you can change it by removing or changing parts of the belief set, but only regarding the object type 'map'.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'function' containing the function.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

[CONTROL Q7]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The following python function:

def function():
    global belief_set
    agent = belief_set['agent'][1]
    parcels = belief_set['parcels']
    batteries = belief_set['batteries']
    if agent['energy'] < 30:
        for battery in batteries.values():
            while agent['coordinates'] != battery['coordinates']:
                if agent['coordinates'][0] < battery['coordinates'][0]:
                    function_2()
                elif agent['coordinates'][0] > battery['coordinates'][0]:
                    function_1()
                elif agent['coordinates'][1] < battery['coordinates'][1]:
                    function_4()
                else:
                    function_3()
        function_5()
    for parcel in parcels.values():
        if parcel['carried_by_id'] is None:
            while agent['coordinates'] != parcel['coordinates']:
                if agent['coordinates'][0] < parcel['coordinates'][0]:
                    function_2()
                elif agent['coordinates'][0] > parcel['coordinates'][0]:
                    function_1()
                elif agent['coordinates'][1] < parcel['coordinates'][1]:
                    function_4()
                else:
                    function_3()
            function_5()
            while agent['coordinates'] != [2, 3]:
                if agent['coordinates'][0] < 2:
                    function_2()
                elif agent['coordinates'][0] > 2:
                    function_1()
                elif agent['coordinates'][1] < 3:
                    function_4()
                else:
                    function_3()
            function_6()

was used by the agent to generate a plan and execute actions to try and achieve the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move to the nearest parcel, pick it up and then move to the delivery cell to deliver it. The agent should also ensure it has enough energy to perform these actions, and if not, it should move to the nearest battery to replenish its energy.

The function might contain calls to other already implemented functions from the following:
- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_7()	Description: The short term goal is for the agent to move to the nearest parcel, pick it up and then move to the delivery cell to deliver it. The agent should also ensure it has enough energy to perform these actions, and if not, it should move to the nearest battery to replenish its energy.


However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 100}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:
	First 4 actions executed:
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 98}}
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
		*  {'event_type': 'object added', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	None
	Last 2 actions executed:
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	None
	- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	None
	Summary of actions executed:
	- Action: action_1, Executed 26 times


After execution of the plan, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 98}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'suggestions' containing your response.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"suggestions": "The function appears to be stuck in an infinite loop, leading to a timeout error. This is likely due to the while loops in the function that keep running as long as the agent's coordinates do not match the target coordinates. However, there is no guarantee that the agent will ever reach the target coordinates because the function does not consider the scenario when the target is unreachable (e.g., blocked by non-walkable cells). To avoid this issue, the function should incorporate a way to break the loop if the target is unreachable. Furthermore, the function should also consider optimizing the actions, as 26 repeated executions of action_1, which just reduces the first coordinate, can be inefficient if the agent needs to also adjust the second coordinate. This can be improved by considering both coordinates while deciding the next action. The short term goal the agent was trying to achieve was to move to the nearest parcel, pick it up, deliver it to a specified cell, and recharge energy if necessary."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The function appears to be stuck in an infinite loop, leading to a timeout error. This is likely due to the while loops in the function that keep running as long as the agent's coordinates do not match the target coordinates. However, there is no guarantee that the agent will ever reach the target coordinates because the function does not consider the scenario when the target is unreachable (e.g., blocked by non-walkable cells).

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, and then deliver it to the delivery cell. If the agent's energy level drops below a certain threshold, it should move towards the closest battery cell to recharge.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 98}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 0, 'energy': 96}}
- Action: action_5 , Events received:

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

From the actions and events, it's clear that the agent only moved and did not pick up any parcels or deliver them. This may be due to the second action failing as no events occurred after its execution. The plan generation process could be improved by taking into account the preconditions required for each action. For example, before executing an action to pick up a parcel, the agent needs to be on the same cell as the parcel. The agent should also handle the case when an action fails by having a fallback plan or trying another action. Furthermore, the agent should also monitor its energy level and plan its actions to ensure it doesn't run out of energy."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent has not achieved its short term goal. The goal was to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up, and deliver it to the delivery cell. From the actions and events, it's clear that the agent only moved and did not pick up any parcels or deliver them. This may be due to the second action failing as no events occurred after its execution. The plan generation process could be improved by taking into account the preconditions required for each action. For example, before executing an action to pick up a parcel, the agent needs to be on the same cell as the parcel. The agent should also handle the case when an action fails by having a fallback plan or trying another action. Furthermore, the agent should also monitor its energy level and plan its actions to ensure it doesn't run out of energy.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent will move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up and move towards the delivery cell. If the energy level is low, it will first move towards the nearest battery, pick it up and then continue with the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should navigate towards the delivery cell while avoiding non-walkable cells and minimizing energy consumption. If the agent's energy level is low, it should navigate towards the nearest battery spawn point to recharge.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'score': 0, 'energy': 92}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 7: {'id': 7, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'parcel', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent moved towards the batteries spawn point but, according to its beliefs, it didn't recharge. This may be due to the agent not having a 'recharge' action in its plan. During plan generation, it should be ensured that if the agent's energy is low and it moves towards a battery, a 'recharge' action should follow. Depending on how the environment and actions are designed, the agent might need to be on the same cell as the battery or just adjacent to it to recharge. This needs to be taken into account during plan generation. Moreover, while moving towards the delivery cell is part of the goal, actual delivery of the parcels is not observed in the actions. A 'deliver' action should also be included in the plan after reaching the delivery cell."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent should move towards the delivery cell, while recharging its energy when needed and picking up any parcels it encounters along the way.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to move to the delivery cell and drop the parcels that the agent is carrying

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the environment to collect all parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while optimally managing energy by collecting batteries when needed.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to have the agent move to the battery spawn location and pick up a battery.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 140, 'energy': 80}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 10: {'id': 10, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 12: {'id': 12, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 13: {'id': 13, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_3 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 140, 'energy': 78}}

The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the environment to collect all parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while optimally managing energy by collecting batteries when needed.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 140, 'energy': 100}}, 'batteries': {}, 'parcels': {8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 10: {'id': 10, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 12: {'id': 12, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 13: {'id': 13, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_13()	Description: The short term goal is to move to the delivery cell and drop the parcels that the agent is carrying
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the battery spawn location and pick up a battery.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to have the agent move to the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel and then move to the delivery cell to drop the parcel.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 140, 'energy': 100}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 10: {'id': 10, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 12: {'id': 12, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 13: {'id': 13, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 14: {'id': 14, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'.

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 300, 'energy': 82}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {}}


For context, the goal was originally pursued with the following instance of the belief set:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'parcels_carried_ids': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'score': 0, 'energy': 86}}, 'batteries': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 4: {'id': 4, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 5: {'id': 5, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 6: {'id': 6, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 7: {'id': 7, 'coordinates': [2, 1], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 8: {'id': 8, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 9: {'id': 9, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 10: {'id': 10, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 11: {'id': 11, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Question: You have to evaluate whether the agent has achieved the following long term goal:
The agent's long term goal is to efficiently navigate the environment to collect all parcels and deliver them to the delivery cell, while optimally managing energy by collecting batteries when needed.

To perform this evaluation, consider the belief set prior to the agent pursuing the goal, and the current belief set. A belief set is the internal representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.

This is the belief set of the agent prior to pursuing the goal and prior to executing the plan to achieve the goal:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 300, 'energy': 82}}, 'batteries': {2: {'id': 2, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {16: {'id': 16, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_13()	Description: The short term goal is to move to the delivery cell and drop the parcels that the agent is carrying
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the battery spawn location and pick up a battery.
- function_15()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel and then move to the delivery cell to drop the parcel.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is for the agent to move towards the nearest object of interest: parcel spawn, battery spawn, or delivery cell. This action helps the agent to learn and memorize the layout of the environment, which is part of the long term goal.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 320, 'energy': 82}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {17: {'id': 17, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_1 , Events received:
	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 320, 'energy': 80}}

	*  {'event_type': 'object changed', 'object_type': 'agent', 'object': {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 320, 'energy': 78}}



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 320, 'energy': 78}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {17: {'id': 17, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

The plan should be improved by including actions to move the agent towards the nearest object of interest such as the parcel spawn at [0, 0] or the battery spawn at [2, 0]."}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The short term goal is to make the agent pickup the parcel from the parcel spawn location and deliver it to the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 2], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 320, 'energy': 78}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {17: {'id': 17, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 18: {'id': 18, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'.

Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to learn and memorize the layout of the environment, identifying the optimal paths to reach important locations such as the parcel spawn, battery spawn, and delivery cell in order to increase efficiency in future tasks.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_13()	Description: The short term goal is to move to the delivery cell and drop the parcels that the agent is carrying
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the battery spawn location and pick up a battery.
- function_15()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel and then move to the delivery cell to drop the parcel.
- function_17()	Description: The short term goal is to make the agent pickup the parcel from the parcel spawn location and deliver it to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move towards the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then deliver it to the delivery cell.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.

Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to learn and memorize the layout of the environment, identifying the optimal paths to reach important locations such as the parcel spawn, battery spawn, and delivery cell in order to increase efficiency in future tasks.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 380, 'energy': 14}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_13()	Description: The short term goal is to move to the delivery cell and drop the parcels that the agent is carrying
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the battery spawn location and pick up a battery.
- function_15()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel and then move to the delivery cell to drop the parcel.
- function_17()	Description: The short term goal is to make the agent pickup the parcel from the parcel spawn location and deliver it to the delivery cell.
- function_19()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then deliver it to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to travel to the parcel spawn location, pick up the parcel, then move to the delivery cell and drop off the parcel, thereby increasing its score and contributing to its long-term goal of optimizing its pathfinding.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [2, 3], 'parcels_carried_ids': [], 'score': 380, 'energy': 14}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [20], 'score': 380, 'energy': 0}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.

Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent has not achieved its short term goal of picking up and delivering a parcel. The agent has picked up the parcel but failed to deliver it due to insufficient energy. The agent's energy reached zero midway during the execution of the plan, preventing it from performing subsequent actions. To improve plan generation, the agent could consider its energy levels during planning. If the energy is not sufficient to complete the plan, the agent should include actions to recharge its energy by visiting a battery spawn location. Additionally, the agent could optimize its path to minimize energy consumption. Finally, the agent should also make sure it has enough energy to not only reach the parcel and the delivery location but also return to a battery spawn location if needed."}

However, during execution, the function gave an error, which can be a runtime error, or an error indicating that the function did not complete in the time limit set (timeout error). This is the error that occurred:
Command '['python3', 'agent_dir/functions/agent_1/functions.py']' timed out after 15 seconds

Right before the execution of the function, the value of the variable 'belief_set' was the following:

The plan generated by the function was executed by the agent. The plan consists of a series of actions. Each action is asssociated to one or more events received by the agent after the action was executed. Note that events received may not be a direct effect of the action. The actions performed by the agent and the events received, up until the error occured, are as follows:
The plan executed was too long, here is a summary:

Your task is to make suggestions on how to avoid this error when writing similar functions in the future. These suggestions can be related to programming mistakes, or to the way the agent is interacting with the environment, depending on what you think went wrong. Also, repeat or recap in your response what was the short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve.
If the error was a runtime error typically received in a terminal, then the problem is probably related to the code. If the error was a timeout error, then the problem is probably related to an infinite loop of actions to execute.

[CONTROL Q2MEM]
Context: An agent is placed into an environment. The agent receives events that describe what is happening in the environment, and acts on the environment by performing actions. You will be asked, through multiple propmts, to provide goal descriptions, functions in python, evaluation and knowledge extraction given actions and events received. The question you will receive will be related to one of these requests.

If you have to provide a function, stick to the following guidelines:
- do not use any external libraries except the standard python libraries
- do not use print statements
- do not split the code into multiple blocks
- fully implement the function

If you have to provide a textual description, make it concise, direct and imperative.

Make sure to format the response as a JSON object following the instructions in the question. If a function is requested, it must be provided in a single line using \n as the newline character. Provide in your response only what is requested. Your answer must contain ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

The agent is identified with ID 1.
Question: Given the long term goal description
The agent's long term goal is to learn and memorize the layout of the environment, identifying the optimal paths to reach important locations such as the parcel spawn, battery spawn, and delivery cell in order to increase efficiency in future tasks.

And given the belief set describing the agent's knowledge about the world

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [20], 'score': 380, 'energy': 0}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 21: {'id': 21, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 22: {'id': 22, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}

Propose a short term goal description in natural language and a function that achieves the short term goal. The short term goal description should be an explanation of what the agent achieves by executing the function. Implement a function that is simple and general, and that can be used in a variety of situations.

The short term goal description should be aligned with the long term goal description, and should be simple, brief and general without referring specific objects of the belief set.

The function can contain calls to already implemented functions from the following library:

- function_1()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_1. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_2()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_2. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1.
- function_3()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_3. The agent moves by 1 cell, decreasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_4()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_4. The agent moves by 1 cell, increasing its second coordinate by 1.
- function_5()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_5. The agent picks up the objects on the ground. The agent has to be in the same cell of the objects to pick them up.
- function_6()	Description: This is a wrapper function for action_6. The agent puts down all the objects it is carrying on the ground. The agent will put down the objects in the cell it is currently in.
- function_13()	Description: The short term goal is to move to the delivery cell and drop the parcels that the agent is carrying
- function_14()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the battery spawn location and pick up a battery.
- function_15()	Description: The short term goal is to have the agent move to the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel and then move to the delivery cell to drop the parcel.
- function_17()	Description: The short term goal is to make the agent pickup the parcel from the parcel spawn location and deliver it to the delivery cell.
- function_19()	Description: The agent's short term goal is to move towards the parcel spawn location, pick up a parcel, then deliver it to the delivery cell.


You can include calls to one or more of the functions from the library. Each function from the library has a description associated, this description describes the goal that the agent achieves by executing that function from the library. The functions from the library do not return any value and do not take any input arguments. The functions from the library can be called multiple times in the function that you provide.

You can access the belief set using the python dictionary variable 'belief_set' in the function that you provide. The variable is updated in real-time as the agent interacts with the environment. Always work directly with the 'belief_set' data structure when updating or accessing values. Do not copy values into local variables. Instead, access and modify them in place via belief_set.

The function that you provide should start with the following code snippet:
def function():
    global belief_set
    ...


Use the following information to provide a better response. This information recaps the short term goal description in the last iteration where an error occured either during execution of the function or because the goal was not achieved. This is the information:
The agent's short term goal was to move to the battery spawn location, pick up a battery, and recharge its energy level. The error that occurred was a timeout error, which suggests that the agent may have entered an infinite loop while trying to achieve its goal. It consistently executed action_2 (moving by 1 cell, increasing its first coordinate by 1). However, the agent's coordinates did not change in the belief set, indicating that the agent was not successfully moving towards the battery or was stuck in a loop due to some condition not being met. In the future, it's important to ensure that the functions have proper terminating conditions and are able to handle unexpected or invalid states of the environment. Additionally, including checks to ensure that actions are resulting in the intended changes would be helpful. This could include validating that the agent's coordinates are changing as expected after movement actions, and that the agent is not attempting to move into non-walkable cells or off the map.


Provide the response in JSON format with the field 'description' containing the short term goal description and the field 'function' containing the function that achieves the short term goal description.

Question: The agent has just finished executing a plan. The plan had the objective of achieving the following short term goal:
The agent's short term goal is to move to the battery spawn location, pick up the battery, and recharge its energy level, ensuring that it does not enter an infinite loop and is able to handle unexpected or invalid states of the environment.

During execution, the agent performed sequencially the actions in the plan. After performing an action, the agent receives some events that inform the agent about how the world has changed. Not all events are a direct result of the action. Keep in mind that an action can fail if its preconditions are not met in the environment.


The following is the belief set that the agent had before executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [20], 'score': 380, 'energy': 0}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 21: {'id': 21, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 22: {'id': 22, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 23: {'id': 23, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


The following list contains all the actions performed as part of the plan, in the order they were performed. Each action is associated with the events that were received shortly after the action was performed.

- Action: action_2 , Events received:
None
- Action: action_5 , Events received:
None



The following is the belief set that the agent has after executing the plan:

{'map': {'width': 4, 'height': 4, 'grid': [{'cell_coordinates': [0, 0], 'cell_type': 'parcels_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [0, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 0], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [1, 3], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 0], 'cell_type': 'batteries_spawn'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 1], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 2], 'cell_type': 'walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [2, 3], 'cell_type': 'delivery_cell'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 0], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 1], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 2], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}, {'cell_coordinates': [3, 3], 'cell_type': 'non_walkable'}]}, 'agent': {1: {'id': 1, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'parcels_carried_ids': [20], 'score': 380, 'energy': 0}}, 'batteries': {3: {'id': 3, 'coordinates': [2, 0]}}, 'parcels': {20: {'id': 20, 'coordinates': [1, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': 1}, 21: {'id': 21, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 22: {'id': 22, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}, 23: {'id': 23, 'coordinates': [0, 0], 'score': 20, 'carried_by_id': None}}}


Provide a boolean evaluation on whether the agent has achieved the short term goal or not.


Also, if you evaluate that the agent has not achieved the short term goal, you need to write suggestions on how to improve plan generation. Your response should describe the goal that the agent is trying to achieve and provide suggestions to improve on what you think went wrong during plan execution. You can refer to specific objects in the belief set or actions performed.



Provide the response in a single line in JSON format with the field 'evaluation' containing only one of the following values: 'True' or 'False'. If the evaluation is 'False, include the field 'suggestions' containing the suggestions as requested, otherwise include the filed 'suggestions' with an empty string as value.
Temperature: 0.7
Response: {"evaluation": "False", "suggestions": "The agent failed to achieve its short term goal, which was to move to the battery spawn location, pick up the battery and recharge its energy level. The agent's plan did not lead to any changes in the belief set, indicating that the actions performed were not successful. This might be due to the fact that the preconditions for the actions were not met. To improve plan generation, the agent should first make sure that the required preconditions for an action are met before executing it. For example, the agent could check its energy level before deciding to move. If the energy level is low or zero, the agent should first plan to recharge before executing other actions. Additionally, the agent could use a more reliable method to identify the battery spawn location, such as using the coordinates provided in the belief set, to ensure successful actions."}

2024-11-14 10:31:53,456 - INFO - [LOOP] Obtained memory update: The agent has failed to achieve its short term goal. The agent was supposed to move towards the nearest parcel, pick it up and then move to the delivery cell to deliver the parcel. However, the agent did not even reach the cell where the parcels are. The agent also dropped its key on its current cell for some reason. The agent should start planning again, making sure to include an action to move to the parcel's cell, pick up the parcel, and then go to the delivery cell. The agent should also not drop the key unless necessary. It seems like the agent is not making the right decisions. The plan generator could be improved by considering the current state of the world more accurately and choosing the necessary steps to achieve the goal.

2024-11-14 10:32:31,504 - INFO - [LOOP] [Q7] Obtained memory update: The error message indicates that the function execution timed out, which is often caused by an infinite loop. Looking at the function, the agent is trying to reach the parcel spawn cell and the delivery cell by constantly comparing the agent's coordinates to those cells. If the path to these cells is blocked or if they are not reachable for some reason, this will result in an infinite loop. To avoid this error in the future, you should implement checks to ensure that the destination cells are reachable before starting to move towards them. Alternatively, you can limit the number of iterations in the while loop, or implement a pathfinding algorithm that can handle obstacles and unreachable destinations. Also, it is important to update the agent's beliefs about the environment after each action, to make sure the agent is aware of its current state and the state of the environment. The short term goal that the agent was trying to achieve was to move towards the parcel spawn cell, pick up any parcels at its current location and then move towards the delivery cell to deliver the parcels.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the agent is making progress towards its goal in each iteration to prevent being stuck in a loop. This can be done by comparing the agent's current state with its previous state and breaking the loop if they are the same. Also, if the agent is stuck, consider adding a condition to change the agent's strategy, such as searching for an alternate path if the current path is blocked.
